XXXX XXXX has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home. I thought all the loans on the home were paid off after my wife passed away on XX/XX/XXXX through the probate of a wrongful death. However, a Countrywide Home Equity line of Credit was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX. My Last payment was in XXXX with the real mortgage company Countrywide before they closed in XXXX. Out of nowhere a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX alleges to have received assignment from Countrywide on XX/XX/XXXX which is about 6 years after my last payment. Bank of ABC was calling me asking me to send documents regarding a previous loan with Countrywide which I did not understand why.

XXXX XXXX claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. Bank of ABC is alleging that it paid off the loan from XXXX XXXX. When it was alleged to already been sold off.

I dont believe any loan was actually paid off to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or Bank of ABC is refusing to produce any payment information or wire transfer as to who, when, why or where this alleged payment was made. Now Bank of ABC is claiming that it alleged to have paid off the loan, and added XXXX XXXX loan to the old Countrywide loan. I never knew anything about this at all. I have never signed anything or applied for any, new loans, refinance, loan modifications, Deed, in lieu, forbearance or reverse mortgage, confirming consolidating anything with Bank of ABC. Nor have I applied for loans above with any other lenders regarding the home.

The amount Im alleged to owe with Bank of ABC is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by Bank of ABC for money that I do not rightfully owe. I also recently discovered that XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX paid it off. I was never informed by my former attorneys that anything was paid off for me to have to pay it later with another lender, or servicer. XXXX XXXX had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXX Bank VA loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by XXXX XXXX in XXXX. However, this can not be confirmed. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX  Received Government Assistance Failed on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was created in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. VA secured loan. In XXXX XXXX XXXX pressured me to sign a loan Modification changing those terms of the original loan from a VA loan to a regular Mortgage without informing me of that. XXXX, XXXX also did not get any approval from the VA to change the terms of the loan which was higher well above my income amount. Which now have me in the situation Im in today. Then soon after the loan Modification was completed a Bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure less than 30 days later after alleged to have signed a subordination agreement with XXXX XXXX. Now Im in a process to be evicted from my home by alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Bank of ABC is using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to Evict me from my home. Bank of ABC also allege that I owe over XXXX to them that I know nothing about as well. I feel I have been a victim of Elder financial abuse, consumer fraud and fair debt collections act practices and mortgage foreclosure scam by hired law firm. It does appear that Bank of ABC and XXXX XXXX were working together as this is connected with the National Mortgage Settlement ( XXXX ). XXXX XXXX filed the first foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that the alleged judgment by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is invalid. The XXXX case on the home is XXXX. However, the eviction case was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. Whomever is working with alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX is still trying to pursue the Eviction case despite being dismissed for want to prosecute on XX/XX/XXXX. The Eviction case was not refiled within one year or vacated. Bank Of ABC is Threatened to sue me for debt not owed. I also have reason to believe that additional lawsuits have been filed against me By Bank of ABC or Alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX that Im not aware of. Nor was I served by anyone regarding any new lawsuits. Seeking assistance with this matter. XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. I hired an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. XXXX XXXX Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. This Bank of ABC statement says that I made payments when I have not made any of these payments to Bank of ABC. I feel that someone took out a loan in my name and identity with Bank of ABC for me to pay it back later which is fraud. Im also a victim of identity theft as well since XXXX. XXXX Page 14 - This a document that was Submitted to the XXXX with false claims that the home was vacant. When the home was not Vacant to have me restricted from accessing the home and my property removed from the home. Despite a wrongfully filed Eviction case against the home during the Illinois Eviction moratorium in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Who is really Bank of ABC? XXXX XXXX has been harassing us at the home and her husband for years. I have proof that she has been disparaging us with random people while claiming to be the realtor of the bank. Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from Bank of ABC. The Vacancy document has Bank of ABC on it as well. This is wire transfer fraud scam that wired money to my former attorney for a settlement that I did not receive any money from. This is not about the false statements by XXXX XXXX claiming the loan was paid off. The loan was forgiven for wrongdoing by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is working with Bank of ABC as well. The amount that was alleged to be paid to XXXX XXXX from Bank of ABC are totally different payment amounts. Bank of ABC has one amount and XXXX XXXX has another amount which is clearly fraud. Any payoff amount has to contain the exact same amount paid out and received. However, Bank of ABC wants me to pay them back money that was never paid to XXXX XXXX loan. Nor did I confirm anything for Bank of ABC to pay off any XXXX XXXX loan. Please look at the loan documents with my XXXX attorney 's mailing address on my statement for him to receive my pay statement only that I had no prior knowledge of. Nor did I authorize this with XXXX XXXX or my former Attorney. A lawsuit was filed in Illinois against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of ABC, Countrywide and XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX deed came from alleged Washington mutual from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX name was involved as part of a robo-signing mill transferring loans fraudulently. The FDIC records show that XXXX  XXXX was acquired by XXXX not XXXX XXXX. I have the proof and documents of all allegations. XXXX XXXX dismissed both foreclosure actions were due to wrong doing not the loan being paid off. Now in XX/XX/XXXX the stories change that Bank of ABC paid off the loan to XXXX XXXX which is false. Now Bank of ABC wants me to pay back a loan alleged to have been paid off to XXXX XXXX. I did not authorize any payoff or loans or anything with Bank of ABC which is fraud. Please review document attachments. I'm consulting with attorneys regarding fraudulent activity... XXXX XXXX continues to not answer or supply accurate information to my complaints filed. Please submit all responses to the lawsuit upload documents for review to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conceal fraud /Elder abuse. XXXX XXXX also forged my name on documents as well. The make home Affordable document from XXXX XXXX is forged and not my signature. Please review the Making Home Affordable document page 5 that the Monthly gross wages are scratched out, and the income expenses are incorrect. Not my hand writing. This is a fraudulent created document. I never signed any court affidavit or any affidavit with XXXX XXXX or any bank, confirming anyone third party or Attorney to be given access to any loan accounts documents. XXXX XXXX never confirmed anything to me to release any account documents to anyone, any attorneys and so forth. I never signed any notarized affidavit with any attorneys as well. XXXX XXXX refuses to take any accountability for there actions which was fraud against me plain and simple. This is not a duplicate complaint, because I have not received any responses. Wire Transfer statement I received from XXXX XXXX Please review the Wire payoff details that was sent by XXXX XXXX appears fraudulent. This was alleged to be paid by Bank of ABC. 1. There is no bank name on the alleged wire transfer 2. The loan amount is incorrect that was alleged to be owed to XXXX XXXX. XXXX. The file name, Load, Bank ID, Sequence and Wire Description the numbers look uneven or altered on the form. 4. No Systems notes 5. No PO information 6. No case numbers 7. XXXX XXXX is a debit card that is from Overseas The bottom line is that the alleged wire transfer form is fraudulent. Bank of ABC has not mailed any response to me. I'm requesting the reply to be sent on this Consumer Financial Protection bureau page to view as well. The site is secured.. Please review the audio. Bank of ABC is making false statements that it sent me a response which is not true While only intentionally avoiding sending the response to the Consumer Financial Protection bureau to hide fraud and Elder abuse. I'm not receiving a response from Bank of ABC. However There is an attorney name XXXX XXXX who was involved in the XXXX XXXX Case XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois. XXXX XXXX worked for a law firm called XXXX and XXXX, Now XXXX XXXX work for a different law XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be working on the XXXX case with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Then is using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX and Bank of ABC interchangeably when the two banks are not involved with one another. XXXX XXXX does not work for any of the banks and do not work for Bank of ABC, XXXX XXXX is a Decoy to cover up the fraud that happened with the XXXX XXXX case regarding the home. XXXX XXXX has also refused to provide any information as to the bank she alleges to work for. This is a fraud scam. I do not think any of my complaints are being directed to Bank of ABC at all from the Consumer Financial Protection bureau but are intercepted from being investigated by the CFPB,. I ; m requesting a response from Bank of ABC Only Respectfully Submitted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX",

         "Since XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I have disputes that Bank of ABC are refusing to to reward me, one for {$380.00}, {$100.00} and {$100.00}. I have given bank of ABC over 90 days to resolve several claims, a adequate amount of time, yet but thy have yet to resolve them. I spoke with several supervisors informed me on XX/XX/XXXX that customers have a due date to file them but the bank has no date to resolve them, and they just now sending the merchant info 2 weeks ago, and she stated bank of ABC allows 6 months to resolve these type issue when i asked for documenation if that is the correct process then it needs to be equal to the customers filing date because no date to resolve them is not right for the customer who is waiting on the claim that was filed, with that being said, I was hoping this would get the attention of an agency more experienced in this type situation because If the customer is supposed to receive a check because then that should be issued to me, but the supervisor stated that bank of ABC allows a 6 month process when disputing a claim... Which is not my policy nor do I think or have seen anything documented that is is their policy",

         "Deposited a check XX/XX/XX23 into our XXXX  account via mobile deposit as we do every week. Notice said a hold would be placed until XX/XX/XX23, this has never happened. I called and spoke with someone and they said it could be released next day, next day I called and they said couldn't release. Customer advised us same day that funds had been removed from his account. Received email XX/XX/XX23 saying delay was extended until XX/XX/XX23 with no reason given. According to reg CC For certain types of deposits, Regulation CC permits financial institutions to delay, for a \" reasonable period of time, '' the availability of funds. A \" reasonable '' time period is generally defined as one additional business day ( making a total of two business days ) for on-us checks, and five additional business days ( total of seven ) for local checks ; your institution may impose longer exception holds, but you may have the burden of proving that they are \" reasonable. '' If you decide to hold funds beyond the period specified in your institution 's general availability policy, you must give the customer a notice at the time of the deposit explaining why the funds are being held and when they will be available. If the deposit is not made in person to an employee of your institution or if you decide to extend the time when deposited funds will be made available after the deposit has been made, you must mail or deliver the notice to the customer not later than the first business day after the banking day on which the deposit is made. Deposits of cash and electronic payments are not eligible for exception holds. The six types of deposits that are eligible are Large deposits ( greater than {$5000.00} ) -- Any amount exceeding {$5000.00} may be held. Your institution must make the first {$5000.00} of the deposit available for withdrawal according to your availability policy and the remainder within the \" reasonable '' time frames discussed above. Redeposited checks -- May be held unless the check was returned because an endorsement was missing or because the check was postdated. In such a case, if the deficiency has been corrected, the check may not be held as a redeposited check. Deposits to accounts that are repeatedly overdrawn -- An account may be considered repeatedly overdrawn and items may be held if On six or more banking days during the previous six months the account had a negative balance, or would have had a negative balance had checks and charges been paid, or On two or more banking days during the previous six months the account balance was negative in the amount of {$5000.00} or more, or would have been had checks and charges been paid. Reasonable cause to doubt the collectibility of a check -- Doubtful collectibility may exist for postdated checks, checks dated more than six months earlier, and checks that the paying institution has said it will not honor. The general criterion for doubting collectibility is \" the existence of facts that would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person '' that the check is uncollectible. The reason for your belief that the check is uncollectible must be included in your notice to the customer. Checks deposited during emergency conditions that are beyond the control of your institution -- Such checks may be held until conditions permit you to provide availability of the funds. Examples of emergency conditions are natural disasters, communications malfunctions, and other situations that prevent your institution from processing checks as it normally does. Deposits into accounts of new customers ( open for less than 30 days ) -- Next-day availability applies only to cash, electronic payments, and the first {$5000.00} of any other next-day items ; the remaining amount from next-day items must be available by the ninth business day. You may choose any availability schedule for deposits of other checks into the accounts of these new customers. None of the above apply to our account or check.",

The compound score is a normalized value between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive), providing an overall sentiment rating.\n",

         "Subject of the complaint : A notice dated XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of ABC was mailed to XXXX XXXX stating that the interest rate of our mortgage loan that they own and service will increase by 0.750 % for 272 months and a final balloon payment of {$250000.00}. We adamantly state again that this mortgage loan modification issued by XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX is fraudulent. The original loan was {$330000.00} and the loan modification exploded it to {$7XX000.00} which includes a balloon payment of {$2XX000.00} has a 44 yr. term with escalating interest rates. Additionally, without notifying us, Bank of ABC extended the loan term to 52 years. We state that the mortgage loan is fraudulent because of documented proof that it was derived from mortgage fraud consisting of unlawful financial policies, manipulated processing times, misrepresentation of information and illegal business practices. \nPurpose of the complaint : We are again appealing to Bank of ABC on legal, moral, ethical and humane grounds to stop perpetuating this mortgage crime and grave injustice done against the XXXX family. There is urgency to this complaint because Bank of ABC is about to implement the most formidable and financially damaging period of our mortgage loan. As a hard working family of XXXX descent with roots in XXXX and XXXX we are living in our home for the past 27 years. However we attribute this achievement and our survival from losing our home not only to our persistent tenacity to fight against the injustice done against us but primarily to our faith in the power of Almighty God. \nWe are aware that Bank of ABC has stated exemption from any blame of mortgage fraud related to the mortgage loan that they currently own and service on our home. Their basis for this claim is that it was not them, but XXXX XXXX XXXX that processed the terms and conditions of our loan. But to us their position is analogous to thieves laundering their stolen money in a bank that benefits from the profits and when confronted about the crime they claim innocence or ignorance. Similarly, the case with our home is analogous to a hard working, honest, individual who was criminally and purposefully setup for theft of {$7XX000.00} and was sentenced to 52 years of punishment for a crime they did not commit. \nOur perspective : We are among the thousands of US citizens, and particularly those of XXXX descent who were victimized by massive mortgage financial crimes committed in XXXX. Our current monthly payments continue to feed the greed of investors with dividends from our fraudulent mortgage loan that was encased in a toxic asset titled XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX. The illegal business strategy all servicers applied to our loan over the 10-yr period was implemented on several levels. First was the abusive and premature action to begin the foreclosure process after only two missed payments and while we were making full monthly payments. Second was the persistent practice of ignoring phone calls and letters about our loan. Third, were the incessant requests by servicers for the exact documents that we had previously submitted. Fourth was the repeated submission of loan modification applications with no approval. Fifth was the practice of changing servicers who regularly demanded starting over the application process. However, the most pervasive strategy was the purposeful and unconscionable manipulation of processing time to extend it so that the excessive charges, missed payments and miscellaneous fees including monthly inspections of the property will accumulate to a financially insurmountable amount. The ultimate goal was for us lose our home. \nSynopsis of the complaint : All information is backed by documentation ) Prior to responding to a solicitation to refinance in XXXX, we had lived in our home for ten ( 10 ) years. The loan was originally made to XXXX XXXX and spouse XXXX XXXX in XXXX each with 50 % ownership certificates to XXXX XXXX. \nXXXX we refinanced for {$330000.00} at 10 % for 30 yrs. with XXXX XXXX XXXX. There were two closings. The loan was finally made to XXXX XXXX and son, XXXX XXXX. Interest rate was to be lowered if we paid the {$2500.00} on time for 6 months and we did. But also six months later the former owners sued the title company XXXX XXXX for issuing a fraudulent title deed with their forged signatures. Refer to court XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We incurred {$25000.00} in legal fees to litigate clearing of the title. \nXXXX XXXX XXXX - Countrywide XXXX XXXX. Two periods of unemployment and legal costs caused us to miss two mortgage payments. XXXX XXXX resumed work in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX soon also after. Payments resumed from XXXX. Our request to put the two payments at the end of the loan was repeatedly refused. \nXXXX Countrywide  returned mortgage payments made in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX stating that our home was in foreclosure proceedings. We sent the first letter requesting mortgage forbearance or any other applicable loan modification option. Countrywide  did not respond. \nXXXX we sent six letters to Countrywide  XXXX  XXXX requesting mortgage forbearance or any other applicable loan modification option. No response. \nXXXX The case involving title deed, lasted 3 yrs and was settled with the title cleared and plaintiffs receiving {$25000.00}. We requested an application from Countrywide  for the Home Affordable Mortgage Program offered by the Obama administration for which we more than qualified. Total income was {$8XX00.00} per yr. No response. We also contacted Senator XXXX for assistance. He responded but was not able to change conditions. \nXXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of ABC XXXX Countrywide  XXXX XXXX. The same problem of no response to our request for a HAMP loan modification application continued. Instead, they offered in-house loan modification programs for {$2800.00} to {$4000.00} monthly. We declined offers and continued to request application for HAMP program that was developed for home owners like us. \nXXXX - New servicer- a ) XXXX XXXX XXXX offered HAMP application but maintained the same business policy of repeatedly requesting the same documents with no loan approval. b ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX filed a status report for foreclosure action against us. We responded XXXX XXXX requesting with stated reasons that the court dismiss the plaintiffs action with prejudice. The foreclosure case was placed on hold. \nXXXX a ) On legal advice XXXX XXXX XXXX for bankruptcy to qualify for approval under a loan modification program in Florida. The program required paying XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX {$1400.00} per month through bankruptcy court and attending mediation for XXXX weeks. We complied with both, and paid a total of {$30000.00}. b ) On XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX denied the loan modification application stating insufficient income. This was most offensive because XXXX purposefully disregarded repeated submission of combined income from XXXX resident family members. They chose to isolate XXXX 's income and use for evaluation. Combined income was {$60000.00}. \nXXXX a ) XXXX XXXX XXXX told our attorney to have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bank statements showing that we pay rent to him. We absolutely refused on the legal grounds of falsifying documents and violating the citys residential code about property. b ) XXXX asked the attorney to have XXXX father deposit his social security check into XXXX bank account. We again refused this illegal request, and mutually ended legal services. We filed our XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint against Select Portfolio Servicing for their illegal business practices with purposeful delays in processing approval of our XXXX loan modification application. \nXXXX a ) We received a notice from the court that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXXXXXX had withdrawn the foreclosure action. b ) We filed a second CFPB complaint against XXXX because they continued the same pattern of illegal business practices of purposeful delay tactics to make our indebtedness impossible to regain and retain ownership of our home. c ) XXXX notified us by telephone that they had approved our HAMP loan modification. But no forms were sent for signatures. Our calls about the matter were ignored for weeks. But in late XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX notified us that our loan and processing was transferred to a new servicer. This was vitriolic. \nXXXX New servicer XXXX XXXX  XXXX . a ) On contact with XXXX  about our approved HAMP loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX they told us that we had to start over the application process. b ) We filed a first CFPB complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX. They responded that XXXX  reported our application as incomplete and that the HAMP program ended on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  stated that they can only offer us an in-house loan modification program. Again this was clearly a collaborative reaction. c ) But We completed and returned the application to XXXX. ( d ) On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from XXXX XXXX  XXXX informing us of impending foreclosure proceedings on behalf of their client, XXXX. ( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX we filed a second CFPB complaint against XXXX  and XXXX because it was clear that they were determined to use fraudulent and illegal means to forcefully rob us of our home. ( f ) In late XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called from XXXX XXXX  XXXX about approval of a loan modification with a trial date of XXXX. But he added that we must pay {$10000.00} to begin the trial period. What ensued was a high volume response from me telling him that his company is attempting to extort money illegally from us, and our intent is to file another CFPB complaint. He quickly got off the telephone and returned soon after with perfuse apologies that he was mistakenly looking at another clients file. \nXXXX a ) We accepted the loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX with a written statement that we adamantly deny owing the fraudulent loan balance of {$7XX000.00}. 27 and we were accepting it under duress. b ) We were convinced that had we rejected it, XXXX would sell our property to a predatory investor for a fraction of what they were demanding from us. During this period It was routine for cars to stop in front of our home and look until we came out our cell phones in hand. We firmly believed then and now that the {$10000.00} demand and enormous loan balance were calculated to force us to reject the loan offer and abandon our home. c ) We contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke XXXX XXXX about our concerns with the loan and followed up with a letter as well as emails to the XXXX Loss Mitigation and Escalation departments. d ) We asked for a 90-day grace period to appeal the XXXX standard loan modification. XXXX XXXX XXXX responded with a letter stating that our loan was owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX and ignored our requests. \nXXXX New servicer Bank of ABC XXXX This was our second and now current involvement with this bank. ( a ) They charged us {$8500.00} for lender placed hazard insurance on XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted BOA by on-line message to point out the major discrepancy with their price and that of the prior servicer, XXXX XXXX  XXXX  who purchased the LPI for the period XXXX period at {$3700.00}, making Bank of ABCs cost over XX0 % more. Bank of ABC stated that it was due to LPI coverage calculated on the loan balance of {$710000.00}. b ) We pointed out that XXXX XXXX  XXXX documented that the LPI was based on the current appraised home value not on the loan balance. We got no response but later noticed a refund of {$8500.00} on the account, and since then the LPI costs are under {$4000.00}. ( b ) In XXXX we filed a CFPB complaint for Bank of ABC to extend access to a COVID-19 loan deferral program to us. This was done. \nConclusion : Below are the main damages sustained in our fight for justice and to retain our home. 1 ) Intense emotional and mental stress. Writing tens of letters, and making numerous phone calls with no response, as well as filing complaints are very distressing mentally and emotionally. 2 ) Severe financial damage and losses : - This mainly applies to the fraudulent and illegal 52-year loan balance of {$7XX000.00}, with yearly increasing interest rates. But it also includes the significant costs of almost {$70000.00} we incurred for the legal and business services we used in our struggle to obtain a loan modification and preserve ownership of our home. 3 ) Currently, there is no path for us to access equity in our home or to sell it for a profit due to the colossal mortgage balance. Therefore at XXXX XXXX XXXX and still in grief for my husband who passed away on XX/XX/XXXX, this situation with our home is ominous, but for Gods presence in my life. This severe injustice put the dream of passing on our home free and clear to our sons at risk, unless circumstances change. 4 ) Devastation of our credit : - Even if I wanted to accept a reverse mortgage on my home, I do not qualify for obvious reasons. Yet we remain confident that we will be vindicated and receive justice, whether it comes from a judge in a court of law or by the power of Almighty God.",

         "I received a letter by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX that was dated XX/XX/XXXX stating my account was debited {$10000.00} because a check was made payable to a signer not on my account. The letter also said the check was deposited into an ATM. The first thing I did was check my wallet and realized my ATM card was missing. I then tried to log into my online banking account but couldn't because the account was frozen/on hold/process of being closed. \n\nI called attempting to find out was going on, but that was absolutely no help. The first rep stated she couldn't help me with the check deposit, but that my account was being closed as a risk based closure. She also sounded like she was half sleep and clearly needed to change her smoke alarm batteries. ( Unprofessional ) Ok ... no help. \n\nI'm transferred to customer service and this rep was much better, but still no help. She did advise that the account was being closed because of this check. I had a payroll check being direct deposited on the next day, so she transferred me to risk to see if they could release my funds. \n\nRisk was also no help. They advised they would not release the direct deposited funds and that I needed to file a fraud claim. They said they could not see why my account was closed only that it was based on risk. LIE. Especially since the previous representative stated it was because of the check. \n\nI called the fraud department, and this is where I got the most help, but still not much. There were multiple transactions not authorized by me and nobody is authorized to use my card. XXXX {$XX00.00} transactions and a {$3700.00} teller withdrawal. There were more, but I don't have access to my statements or transactions as the bank disabled my online banking. So now I actually have no idea all of the transactions that took place on my account. I explained that I realized the card was missing once the letter came in the mail saying a check was deposited into the ATM. None of this mattered. The bank denied my claim. No follow up asking what happened or anything. \n\nThe letter I received from the bank states the fraudulent check was deposited on the XXXX, but all the transactions took place on the XXXX according to the representative from the Fraud Dept. So, I am questioning why would the bank approve these transactions when there weren't much funds in the account? I really would like to review these transactions myself because speaking to the reps over the phone is so confusing and frustrating as it seems nobody really cares. \n\nA simple camera pull from the ATM transaction and teller withdrawal would prove that I did not make these transactions and I'd be prepared to move forward with criminal charges against whoever it was. I did not give anyone authorization to make these fraudulent charges as the bank states and I sure didn't make them myself. This is just their excuse to not cover the charges. \n\nMy actual check that was direct deposited into my account on XX/XX/XXXX was taken by the bank and they will not release my funds. So now I have no bank account, a negative balance resulting from fraud, inaccurate/negative reporting as they stated the closure will be reported to XXXX, and I'm without my check that I worked XXXX weeks for. This was my check to get me out of the hole, but not only am I victim of fraud, I'm a victim of big banks because they won't release my funds and approve a claim that is clearly fraud against me. \n\nBank of ABC is violating Reg E from their inaccurate claim review process. They advertise {$0.00} fraud liability, but when you're a victim of fraud they do not honor that statement. And I see that from my own personal case and the MANY reviews online. \n\nThey are violating FCRA by furnishing inaccurate negative information about my checking account. If it does not say account was closed due to customer was a victim of fraud, then it's inaccurate. And there are several UDAAP violations as the banks failure to properly review my claim has caused me significant monetary and non-monetary harm. The bank also approved over {$5000.00} in transactions when there were only a couple of XXXX dollars in the account, negligence on the banks part!",

         "The case is about Bank of ABC 1 ) internationally neglecting reports about checking frauds and enabling illegal activities to continue, 2 ) failing to protect customers interest by lying and delaying response to financial frauds, 3 ) push customers to open new account by lying, 4 ) failed to inform law enforcement about illegal activities and refuse provide information to assist on-going investigation, 5 ) intentionally set up obstacles to prevent customers to close their bank account, and 6 ) lying about its customers services. \n\nI had been reporting multiple times to the bank since XX/XX/XXXX that my checkbook was stolen and was used without my authorization, but until now, financial frauds on my account continued. I reported my case to the XXXX Police Department on XX/XX/XXXX. However, in order to maintain my account and push me to open new ones, the bank lied and intentionally prevented me to stop the malpractices by closing my account. As a result of the banks tactics, I can not use my account, multiple frauds happened, and merchants continued to be victimized. Below is the detail narrative : On XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, Bank of ABC call me by about a suspicious check of XXXX dollars on my checking account ( ending with XXXX ) trying to be deposited in XXXX XXXXXXXX where I used to live. I told the bank that my checkbook was stolen when I was moving, and this transaction is a financial fraud. I told the bank to take note and not to allow other similar transactions to happen. The bank stopped the payment ( so it did not have a record on my account ) on that check but do nothing to protect my account from further frauds ( which I know that fact later ). \n\nOn XXXX XXXX, my checking account was used illegally again for a XXXX transaction in XXXX. I called the bank while the amount was still processing. After 40 minutes wait on phone and some transferring between different departments, the bank told me that there was nothing they could do about it, because the transaction is still processing ; I must wait for it to go through and then filed a claim. The bank said that I could file the claim without calling again ( online ) and they already took notes on the account. But they did not suggest any methods to prevent further faults. When I requested information on the XXXX transactions for police investigation, they refused to provide. When I mentioned about moving my money to other banks and then close the account, they lied to me that I could not do that. They suggested me to freeze the account and open a new account with them where all my money will be safely transferred to. The bank threatened me that if I freeze the account, all the money could not be used until the claim was resolved, which it said would take around 30 days. I was then pushed to a sales representative and opened a new checking account ( ending with XXXX ). The bank lied to me that the process will be short, and the sales can take care all the issues. With a new account, the issue did not solve, and I was transferred back to the fraud department where the staff told me that the XXXX dollars in my old account that was still processing ( including the XXXX dollars in fraud payment ) and can not be transferred. I spent more than 3 hours in call with the bank and when one associate could not solve the issue, I was transferred to another department which means a minimum 30-min wait inline. The bank knows that I live 100 miles from its closest branch and could not go in them in person. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the fraud XXXX charge went through my account, and I could not file a claim online as promised by the bank, so I called and wait again to speak with associates. And the staff picked up the phone still asked me about whether the XXXX transaction was made by me, and it means the bank did not took note of my reports. I was then transferred to another department ( another XXXX ) to file a fraud claim which also involve multiple unnecessary confirmations and procedures. The airtime in my phone plan is used up and the call ended suddenly, and I failed to complete my claim. But at the end of the day, the XXXX check was rejected together with my legit other transactions. Since the refund was still processing, I can not close me account. \nWith my account in freeze, on XX/XX/XXXX, another fraud charge of XXXX XXXX paid to XXXX XXXX appeared on my account and the account went to XXXX dollars ( XXXX minus my remaining XXXX dollars ). I called the bank and wait again to speak to an associate from check fraud department where the staff told me that she could do nothing and transferred me to AHC department. The staff in AHC department told me that the check fraud department should take care of my problem. I requested to close my account and was told that I can not, because the ongoing transactions. I said that I already freeze the account two days before, and they did not answer. I was then transferred back to the check fraud department which also could not solve the problem. On XXXX XXXX the same date, the bank informed me that there was another unusual check paid to merchants ( I did not know ) appeared and ask my authorization. I reject to authorize the check. \n\nIn the past three days, I have spent more than 5 hours speaking to may associates in the bank across the country. The bank promised to send me survey about my experience in each call, but I never receive one, and I have nowhere to go and communications with the bank always reach a dead end. The financial fraud continued while I and merchants continued to suffer, so I decided to file the report with CFPB.",

         "In XX/XX/XXXX, I was the victim of fraud committed via a phishing attack. A bad actor impersonating my boss emailed me and then texted me, directing me to purchase items ( gift cards ) for what were purportedly business-related expenses, with the promise that I would be reimbursed for these charges. I purchased these gift cards using my Bank of ABCn ATM card ( approximately {$4900.00} ) and my Bank of ABC credit card ( approximately {$7900.00} ). At the bad actor 's request, I provided the gift card numbers to the bad actor, who used the gift cards for his/her own purpose. I received no benefit from the gift cards, and was not reimbursed for them. Nor were these transactions \" authorized '' because they benefited a stranger ( not my employer/boss ) and I was not reimbursed for them as I expected. During the course of this conduct, I also provided the individual who I thought was my boss with my bank account number and routing number so I could be reimbursed for these charges ; the bad actor requested and used this information to help perpetrate the fraud. As soon as a I realized what had occurred, I called Bank of ABC and explained what occurred ; the Bank of ABC representative said these charges were \" fraudulent '', placed a hold on my accounts, and told me to got to a branch office the next day- which I did. I also reported these occurrences to the police department ( XXXX XXXX, Maryland ) ; the officer referred to this occurrence as a \" fraud. '' When I went to the Bank of ABC branch in XXXX XXXX, Washington DC, I was directed to a Bank of ABC employee named XXXX XXXX. I described what happened and how the charges were placed on my debit and credit card and my bank account number/routing number had been provided to the bad actor ; XXXX XXXX said these charges were \" fraudulent '' and that I would not be liable for them. We also discussed closing my existing bank account since the numbers had been compromised and opening a new bank account. XXXX XXXX agreed this was the correct approach and said that I would \" probably not '' be charged for checks to open the new account/that I would be reimbursed for these checks because I was a \" fraud victim. '' ( In fact, I was charged {$40.00} for these checks and not reimbursed ). \nApproximately 10 days later, I received a letter from Bank of ABC saying that I was liable for these charges. When I called the number Bank of ABC provided on the letter, she said I was liable because I was the victim of a \" scam '' not a fraud. She did not dispute any of the facts as I described them to her and as they are set forth above. Nor did she explain how these charges were \" authorized. '' This \" scam '' versus \" fraud '' argument is legally irrelevant and is not a real distinction. First, Bank of ABC 's customer/banking agreement that I signed and its own website say that customers are not liable for fraudulent charges/fraud. They do not distinguish \" XXXX '' from \" scams '' or say that customers are not protected in the event of a \" scam. '' Bank of ABC drafted these materials and if they wanted to distinguish the concept of fraud from the concept of a scam, and the protections afforded to clients who were the victim of each, Bank of ABC could have done so- but it did not. Second, the events that occurred were referred to as \" Fraud '' or \" Fraudulent '' by Bank of ABC 's own personnel ( XXXX XXXX ) and by the police officer who completed the police report. Moreover, the definition/concept of \" fraud '' and \" scam '' are interchangeable : XXXX 's Online dictionary defines \" scam '' as a \" fraudulent act '' and says that \" scam '' is a synonym of \" fraud. '' Finally, under the CFPB 's interpretation of Regulation XXXX, this is an unauthorized transaction, for which a consumer is not liable : Comment, 12 CFR 1005.2 ( m ) -3 and 1005.2 ( m ) -4 : \" Access device obtained through robbery or fraud. An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud. '' Bank of ABC has not given me an opportunity to appeal it decision that I was liable for these charges. Rather, it has engaged in dilatory tactics where it sends me letters saying the documents that formed the basis for its decision are attached - but they are not actually attached - and that I can request copies of these documents. I have made numerous requests to Bank of ABC, both by phone and in writing, for the documents it used to reach its decision that I was liable for these charges. The first two times I made this request by phone, and the Bank of ABC representative said there were documents that it used to make its decision and that they would provide those documents to me. I told them that I needed those documents so I could appeal its purported decision that I was liable for these fraudulent charges. However, Bank of ABC never sent these documents, so in XX/XX/XXXX I made a written request for these documents. When I finally spoke to a Bank of ABC representative in XX/XX/XXXX, she told me that my dispute was closed. I told her her that I had been waiting for the documents that Bank of ABC used to resolve my dispute to submit my appeal and that it was wrong to close my case when I was still waiting for the documents that Bank of ABC promised. She then transferred me to a supervisor, who said there were documents but that I need a subpoena to get them ; I pointed out that prior letters that Bank of ABC sent me said I could request those documents and that Bank of ABC representatives said I was entitled to these documents. The manager told me that was incorrect. After submitting another written request to Bank of ABC requesting these documents and attempting to appeal the decision, I called Bank of ABC again in XX/XX/XXXX. When I requested the documents that Bank of ABC used to make its decision, as referenced in the letters from Bank of ABC, I was initially told that no documents exist. I then asked how Bank of ABC made the decision to deny my claim/dispute without any documents, at which point she said that documents were used but that I can't have them, but she would not confirm this in writing. \nIt appears that Bank of ABC never investigated what occurred, never intended to consider my appeal/dispute, never gave me a chance to present my case, and made the dispute process as Kafka-esque as possible in an attempt to obfuscate, delay, and ultimately wear me down into accepting its decision which was contrary to numerous representations made to me. Bank of ABC 's letters regarding the fraudulent charges on my credit card are similarly flawed ; for example, one of these letters refers to a disputed \" transaction '' with a merchant even though there were multiple transactions with three separate merchants. \nBank of ABC has also refused to close my bank account that was compromised by the fraudulent actor, even though I directed that account closed at the meeting with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ( nd she agreed to do so ) and in numerous subsequent written communications. Rather, Bank of ABC unilaterally reversed my instructions to close the account and refused to reconsider. Keeping this account open exposes me to further risk of fraud, and also increases the risk that one of my bank accounts may be overdrawn and increases Bank of ABC 's banking fees/revenues and reportable open accounts. \nBy initially telling me that I was not liable for these charges but then paying the chares to the merchant without prior notice, Bank of ABC foreclosed me from meaningfully challenging these transactions with the merchants or taking other remedial measures. \nIt should be noted that I also incurred charges as a result of this fraud on an ATM card and a credit card issued by other financial institutions, both of which covered/did not hold my liable for these charges.",

         "On XX/XX/XXXX my husband, XXXX, responded to an offer to purchase an I-pad for {$XX.00}. He gave them his credit card number, email address and home address. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we received our Bank of ABC ( BofA ) credit card statement in the mail and noticed that a charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX from a company called XXXX  out of Texas and another charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX from a company called XXXX out of XXXX for {$110.00}. XXXX called XXXX about the {$110.00} charge and found out it was a vitamin supplement company. Their representative gave him another number to call and that person referred him to their \" support '' website. XXXX knew he was getting the run around, so we filed a fraud complaint with Bank of ABC over the phone and included both charges because neither XXXX of us ever ordered any supplements from either company. At the time, I do not believe we connected it with the ordering of the I-pad. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of ABC sent a denial letter stating the merchant, XXXX claimed the {$110.00} was a subscription or re-occuring bill and that we were repeat customers. I called the company and they said XXXX ordered through some sweepstakes contest, but they couldn't help me since BofA was handling the dispute. The representative said that she would make a note in the file that we didn't order any products from them and never received any products from them On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BofA explaining that I thought the 2 charges were somehow related and reiterated that neither one of us ordered, nor received supplements from either company. It was my opinion that the first charge for {$XX.00} from XXXX sold XXXX 's information and credit card number to the second company, XXXX which is a company in another state. The dispute for {$110.00} was reopened. The {$XX.00} charge was still pending at the time. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, We received a denial from BofA for the {$110.00} charge.The company, XXXX, submitted a receipt that said we ordered 1 product for {$110.00} ( no description of product, just says product qty 1 ) and no shipping information ( how shipped, shipping tracking number, etc ). Bank of ABC therefore denied our claim saying that was proof we received the merchandise. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Called to explain the situation and dispute again. The Representative just chastised me for falling for a scam. Was very condescending so I gave up talking to him. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Called Fraud and re-explained what happened. Reiterated that the only order made was for an I-pad for {$XX.00} that never came, and we never ordered nor received any supplements or ipads. Case was put in dispute again. Rep said the {$XX.00} charge was still pending. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Received letter from BofA denying dispute again for {$110.00} stating giving the reason that I granted access to an authorized user on my credit card, thereby I have to accept responsibility and that the home address, phone number or email address matches what the merchant has on file. If XXXX ordered and received a product, I do accept responsibility. In fact, I believe I stated in the next call to BofA that if anything, we were responsible for the {$XX.00} charge since XXXX placed an order. However I felt that since we still didn't receive any I-pad, it would still be a dispute for a product ordered, but not received. This denial in my opinion did not address the dispute or act of fraud in any way. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - I called BofA and explained the situation again and the XXXX suggested I file the ordering of the laptop as a billing dispute instead of fraud ( which I now found out that BofA considers to be a totally different department ). I told the rep I felt it was both a fraud related and a billing dispute. I felt the whole thing was fraudulent since we never ordered supplements. It was also a billing dispute, since we were being charged for products we never received ( nor ordered ). She said we couldn't claim both and suggested combining both claims into XXXX as they seemed to be related. I agreed. I asked to speak to the person who decides the case, but was told that BofA only allows customers to talk to Associates. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was told no one was available now, so she took my number and said a supervisor would call me back. No one ever did, so I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to find out about late fees and interest since my bill for the {$110.00} in disputed charges was due that Monday and BofA wouldn't hold off billing me on the disputed charges. I felt I was forced to pay the minimum amount so I wouldn't incur a late penalty. \n\nReceived a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they resolved my claim for {$XX.00} ( which was 113 days from my original dispute for that claim ) and that they resolved that dispute in my favor. No explanation. On the same date, they declined the dispute for the {$110.00} charge because it was made by an authorized user. This is so frustrating because this answer does not address the complaint/dispute which I have stated in numerous conversations with BofA reps XXXX and they seem to agree with me when they opened and re-opened the disputes. But when it gets to the fraud team, they just don't understand so I will summarize below. \n\nI maintain the dispute to be as follows : 1 ) XXXX ordered an I-pad on XX/XX/XXXX for {$XX.00}. While he can recall the amount, he does not recall, the company name. He has not received an i-pad to date. \n2 ) BofA credit card statement revealed 2 charges. XXXX for {$XX.00} and another for {$110.00}. Both companies seem to sell supplements. Neither XXXX nor I ordered supplements, so I disputed the charges immediately. \n2 ) It seems the second merchant ( not sure if same merchant or not since different names and different states ) told BofA that we are \" existing customers '', but have provided no proof that we are existing customers who have ordered products from them in the past, nor have they provided proof that they shipped us anything. \n3 ) We maintain that neither one of us have ever received/nor ordered any supplements or products from either company ( the receipt sent to us only says product ), nor have we received an i-pad. \n\nWhile most of the BofA Reps have been friendly and seem to understand the situation, and dare I say seem to agree the transactions were fraudulent, when it gets to the fraud division, things seem lost in translation. I tried everything possible to get BofA to reverse the charges BEFORE they paid either merchant. These merchants are so blatantly fraudulent and a scam, which we didn't realize until after we got our statement with the charges. BofA was negligent in protecting us as their customer. \n\nI would like to add, that I have no documents except those that BofA sent me, since we did not order any supplements from either merchant, nor did we receive any products. The merchants have not sent us anything at all.",

         "In XX/XX/XXXX I was the victim of a phishing attack. A fraudulent actor texted me, posing as my boss, and directed me to purchase gift cards and provide the gift card number. I made these purchases using both my Bank of ABC credit card and debit card, totaling approximately {$13000.00}. In the course of this fraud, the fraudster also obtained my bank account number and routing number. \nWhen I realized what occurred, I disputed the charges and called Bank of ABC, which put holds on my accounts and directed me to go to a bank branch to further resolve the issue. The next day, I went to the bank branch, explained the situation, and was directed to a Bank of ABC employee ( XXXX XXXX ). I explained the situation to XXXX XXXX, and she said that I was a fraud victim and would not be liable for the charges. We also discussed the need to close the existing bank account and open a new one since the fraudulent actor had received my bank routing number and password. I completed paperwork to close the existing account and open a new account, and ordered checks for the new account. XXXX XXXX told me that because I was a fraud victim, the cost for my new checks would \" probably '' be reimbursed. Based on XXXX XXXX 's representations that I was not liable for these charges, I did not attempt to contact the merchants who sold these gift cards or take other potential loss mitigation steps ( other than contacting the police ). For example, these merchants have a policy limiting the quantity of gift cards that can be sold to one person on a given day and a merchant exceeded that policy. Had I known Bank of ABC was not going to honor its word to me and make me liable for the fraud charges, I would have challenged the transactions with the merchant. By misrepresenting to me my responsibility for these charges and paying the merchant for them Bank of ABC deprived me of that opportunity, and Bank of ABC did not make that argument itself. \n\nApproximately one week later, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Bank of ABC stating that my dispute was denied and that I was liable for the debit card charges. The letter also states that \" If we used documents to resolve your claim, we've included them with this letter, '' and that \" If you'd like copies of the documents we used to make this decision, please call us at XXXX. '' Contrary to the statements in the letter, no documents were attached. When I called the number on this letter, I referenced the statement in the letter, told her I intended to appeal the denial of my dispute, and asked to receive the documents used to resolve the dispute ; the Bank of ABC representative informed me that documents were used to resolve this dispute and that they would be provided to me. However, Bank of ABC did not send those documents. Instead, about one week later, a Bank of ABC employee called me and told me that the appeal of my dispute had been denied. I told her that I had not yet submitted my appeal as I was waiting for the documents used to resolve my dispute, and she promised to send them to me. But I have still not received such documents. \n\nSubsequently, in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I have written and called Bank of ABC seeking the documents related to this dispute. Bank of ABC has ignored my written requests, but when I finally get through to someone on the phone, I get conflicting answers regarding the documents : I have been told there are documents ; I have been told there are documents but Bank of ABC will not provide them to me without a subpoena ; and in XXXX conversation I was initially told there were not documents and then when I asked how a decision was made on my dispute the representative told me there were documents but I could not have them. Each time I have asked Bank of ABC for a written statement regarding whether I can access the documents it used to resolve my dispute ; however, Bank of ABC has declined to do so and instead sends another letter telling me to call the number to request the documents but when I call and request the documents I am not provided the documents or an explanation of what occurred. This circular process appears to be designed to prevent me from getting information about the dispute resolution process or appealing the denial. Bank of ABC employees ' statements that no documents were used to resolve my dispute, or that I can not receive those documents, directly contradict the representations in the communications from Bank of ABC. \n\nAs part of the fraud, charges were also made on my Bank of ABC credit card. While Bank of ABC ( XXXX XXXX XXXX initially told me I would not be liable for these charges, in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating that I was liable for these charges. The letter refers to a \" charge '' at a \" merchant '' and says that I had similarly made other charges at that \" merchant. '' However, this fraud involved multiple charges/transactions at XXXX different merchants, and Bank of ABC XXXX XXXX correspondence and my online banking records indicated multiple disputes at multiple merchants. Thus, the language in Bank of ABC 's letter does not even address all of the disputed transactions. Moreover, I had never shopped at XXXX of the merchants involved before, and the nature of the products ( gift cards ) and amounts purchased are not at all consistent with my past charges. When I pointed this out to Bank of ABC in a letter, it wrote a second letter that merely changed \" merchant '' to \" merchants '' but did not address the other issues I raised. I have tried communicating with Bank of ABC further about these credit card disputes but it has been unwilling to do so. \n\nDuring several of the XXXX I have spoken to Bank of ABC about these disputes, they have acknowledged mistakes on the part of their employees, that their communications were misleading, or that their protocols were not followed. However, they have refused to provide me any actual remedy, or even give me an opportunity to challenge the substance of these dispute denials. \n\nDespite my clear instructions to Bank of ABC to close my existing checking account because the account number and routing number had been obtained by a fraudster, Bank of ABC unilaterally refused to close this account. Specifically, Bank of ABC sent me a letter in XX/XX/XXXX saying that I had requested that it keep this account open, when in fact I requested the account closed and it is illogical that I would ask it to keep open an account that had been compromised when I opened a new checking account. Bank of ABC has kept this open despite my telling them in writing and verbally on multiple occasions to close the account because it is at risk of fraudulent charges. Bank of ABC 's failure to do so subjects me to heightened risk of further fraud. Moreover, notwithstanding XXXX XXXX 's statement and its refusal to close my existing account, Bank of ABC charged me {$40.00} for checks for the new bank account even though there is an option to order checks at no charge. If I had known that Bank of ABC would refuse to close my existing and fraud-compromised account, I never would have paid an unnecessary fee for unnecessary checks for my new account. \n\nThe letters that Bank of ABC has sent denying my claims are internally inconsistent, inherently inconsistent, and do not address all aspects of my dispute or reasons I am not liable for these charges. \n\nAs a result of this fraudulent activity, charges were placed on my credit or debit cards with XXXX other banking institutions ; these institutions did not hold me responsible for these fraudulent charges.",

         "I was robbed via XXXX and Bank of ABC itself for {$3700.00}. It is a known scam where someone poses as a-out-of-country film production company wanting to hire a local production manager to facilitate the job. Nothing this ( fake ) company asked me to do was out of the ordinary for this kind of work, the only weird thing is they send a check priority mail, which is how they got me, instead of electronically transferring funds as is the norm these days. \n\nThe XXXX of it is, the two accounts I was tricked into transferring money to are also BOFA customers and they did nothing, everything is set up to help the scammers, not the victims. Even though I figured out I was being scammed before the check bounced, the BOFA fraud people had me running around in vain for a month, their story changed every time I talked to them, local law enforcement wont do anything because it was a multi-state scam, the FBI does nothing except have you fill out Internet Crime Complaint ( IC3 ). I thought they would at least freeze the funds and investigate, I presented all the evidence, they do nothing except protect the folks that stole my money. Now Ive learned that BOFA is part owner of XXXX, all the while, the BOFA fraud folks told me it was more a XXXX problem than a bank problem. \n\nI was so embarrassed, Ive sniffed out so many scam attempts on both me and loved ones but they finally got me, it was a month-long, elaborate operation. They contacted me via email under the guise of hiring me to production manage a film shoot for them, a production company from XXXX XXXX. They sent a script, employment/tax forms to fill out, they even sent one back for me to correct because I missed something. The people doing this obviously had film business experience because everything happened like it would for being hired to manage a location job with out of country people- they give you the money to run the job so they dont have to pay foreign transaction fees on every transaction. \n\nThey told me a check was on the way, and gave me explicit directions on depositing it which was the red flag I missed. I researched the production company and there was a legit film company with this guys name I was supposedly communicating with right there on the website as a director. What they did on their correspondence with me was use email address that look like they are from the company they were pretending to be from but one character would be different so you wouldnt notice unless youre looking for it - I discovered all this backtracking. There were texts too, even a couple live phone conversations. \n\nThey sent a tracking # for the priority mail with the check they were sending, I looked up the address it was coming from and it was a legit residential address in XXXX, Texas, not an abandoned warehouse or false address. When the check arrived it was from a trust in New Jersey, I looked that up too, it was a legit company. I was living in XXXX, Arizona at the time all this went down. Turns out this was all by design, they make sure the check arrives on a Friday, they say explicitly to deposit it in the atm ( why? - the big red flag ). This is the only reason they got me. I was going to go into the bank and deposit it that way but unfortunately there was a line so I did just stay in the car and go to the drive-through atm out of laziness, not because they instructed me to do so. \n\nThey told me to deposit the check in the atm on Friday and to send them a photo of the deposit receipt, then to check my account the next day, Saturday, to see that the check had been deposited into my account. They found this gray area to mess with. By now, most of us are used to the electronic transactions that either show right up into your account when something is deposited or there is some kind of indication that it is pending. When you deposit a check at the atm the receipt you get says only {$300.00} of the deposited check amount ( {$3900.00} ) is available. Here is what they exploit, when I got online to check my account that Friday, sure enough, only {$300.00} of that deposit was available. When I signed in the next day the full {$3900.00} shows that its there. But its not really, thats the XXXX of it. Your account online shows the full amount of the deposited check even though the funds are not actually there. \n\nIts the old school banking, they trust you as a customer that you arent depositing checks that bounce so even though the funds havent literally been transferred between the banks yet, unlike electronic transfers that are either there or they arent. So once I thought the funds were there, I thought I was on the job, like any other. If the bank would simply indicate what funds are in your account and what is pending this scam wouldnt work. What is the greed factor that keeps them from honest accounting on our statements? \n\nThis fake XXXX XXXX company sent me Purchase orders for camera and lighting equipment, along with invoices to two different individuals. This is common in the film business, that crew members rent out their own equipment, so nothing strange there. They had me do this all via XXXX, although along the way they had me set up a paypal payment to a vendor then rescinded it - what did I care, it was all their money right? \n\nThe plan was to have a in-person meeting the next day Sunday where I would meet this guy I was communicating with all along, he picked out a XXXX near my place to meet and go over the upcoming shoot, and to give me another check to deposit. I was to be paid out of what remained from these deposits ; like an idiot, at this point I had made three XXXX payments to two different people, {$2500.00}, {$1000.00}, and {$XX0.00} for a total of {$3700.00} of which turned out to be all of my money. They did send more invoices to pay to see how far I would go but at least I stopped when I did, waiting for the next check. Of course no one showed up for the meeting. \n\nAt first I thought no big deal, stuff happens, but as I laid in bed that night I started figuring it out, went to the bank website to research the check deposit procedure and realized Id been had, and called BOFA bank fraud that night to report it. Even though the check didnt bounce, and my money went to two other BOFA accounts and I had ( and still have ) all the evidence. They told me to file a local police report which I did and to have them issue a subpeona for the information from the bank fraud investigation. I spent countless hours trying to make that happen only to find that its impossible, bank should have never told me that. The scammers did a good job, since three states are involved, there is nothing local law enforcement or check fraud department can do. \n\nEveryone involved directed me to fill out a Internet Crime Complaint ( XXXX ) form with the FBI, which I did but they dont do anything other than collect the data, I talked to several agents. \n\nEach thing with the bank fraud was to wait 45 days for them to finish their investigation. Once I figured out law enforcement either couldnt or wouldnt do anything and reported this all back to BOFA fraud dept. they said they would take another 45 day investigation and then send me all the evidence they had so I could use it if I wanted to hire a lawyer. When I received that report they said they couldnt send me any of that information due to its sensitivity, or the like. They market they XXXX out of how hard they are fighting against scammers and fraud but in my experience, the whole system is set up to protect the scammers, not the victim. The fact that this all took place within the accounts of the banks own customers and they wont do anything about it is mind blowing. \n\nMonths after all that I received, from BOFA, a black and white copy of the bounced check and a letter saying it was still a legal check if I wanted to re-deposit ( as if someone just made a mistake having insufficient funds ) which, of course, got me to thinking. I got lucky here, I found an actual human being in a manager of the local BOFA branch who I scheduled a meeting with in the very bank I made the deposit of the fraudulent check. I incorrectly thought if I could find out if there was any money in the account of where that check came from that if I timed it right, I could re-deposit it and recover my loss. \n\nI had my file folder with all the evidence with me when I arrived. Right away, he saw the USPS priority mail cardboard envelope I had and he asked if that was what the check came in, it did. He said if I saw you in line with that, or a savvy teller would have alerted me to the strong possibility that it was a scam. He said pretty much the only people sending out priority mail checks this way are scammers! \n\nNext, he took a look at the black and white copy of the bounced check, the check itself was this beautiful full color official looking thing with gold flake embossing etc., he could even tell on the black and white copy that it was fake, he pointed out the subtle differences in the font and that no official check has font variances. He also said a teller couldve called the police on me as if I was trying to pass a bad check! \n\nHe explained to me how the scammers just purchase the check paper and create their own checks using stolen bank account information and print them up themselves. Their account info was stolen to use on the fraudulent home-made check to me, the account holders were not part of the scam, they are also victims. \n\nI recently moved back to XXXX XXXX and was randomly contacted again ( Im listed on film business crew websites ) to be hired for a job, using the very same verbiage as my incident except this time saying a lot about covid - I contacted the FBI again and explained this whole thing to them, explaining that I was willing to go along with it, like I wanted to be hired, we could follow through and bust these people, but they dont care, didnt want to do anything, told me to fill out another XXXX form, crazy. \n\nI went as far up the griping line at BOFA via telephone and letters, nothing. XXXX, if nothing else, I just begged them to simply indicate on your account whether a check has actually cleared or not, how the XXXX difficult would that be? Just indicate whether a check has been deposited and pending, or fully deposited - if they did that, this specific type of scam wouldnt work. Why dont they? There surely must be some greed reason there. \n\nBoth the BOFA fraud people, and FBI told me there was a rash of these scams directly targeting film industry people. The FBI kept saying they can only collect the data, and when something becomes a big enough problem ( whatever that threshold is ) then they will do something about it. I countered that by asking if there was a way for other victims to contact each other if they chose to do so, so we could make a bigger case out of it they said no way. \n\nI state it again, the industry and law enforcement keep trumpeting how hard they are fighting for our protection when in reality they are covering for the thieves.",

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX alleges that the loan was paid off. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX suddenly dismisses the lawsuit which is the second foreclosure lawsuit XXXX XXXX has dismissed on the home since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX A payoff statement was ordered from alleged to be Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX sends a letter to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating congratulations the loan was paid off with a release of mortgage. XXXX XXXX has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home. I thought all the loans on the home were paid off after my wife passed away on XX/XX/XXXX through the probate of a wrongful death. However, a Countrywide Home Equity line of Credit was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX. My Last payment was in XXXX with the real mortgage company Countrywide before they closed in XXXX. Out of nowhere a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX alleges to have received assignment from Countrywide on XX/XX/XXXX which is about 6 years after my last payment. Bank of ABC was calling me asking me to send documents regarding a previous loan with Countrywide which I did not understand why. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure on the home without my knowledge or being served in any lawsuit. XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. When I found about it the foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX it was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX stated to have no record of the home or involvement with Bank of ABC. It appears that Bank of ABC using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX as a decoy to hide Bank of ABC from any involvement or liability with the foreclosure lawsuit. In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I also discovered that documents were forged in my name as if I made appearances in court when I was working at the VA at the time. Then I hired an attorney on XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. XXXX XXXX XXXX to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. Bank of ABC is alleging that it paid off the loan from XXXX XXXX. When it was alleged to already been sold off. Bank of ABC instead alleged to have consolidated the loan to avoid XXXX XXXX foreclosure on the home that would have wiped any second liens on the title. I dont believe any loan was actually paid off to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or Bank of ABC is refusing to produce any payment information or wire transfer as to who, when, why or where this alleged payment was made. Now Bank of ABC is claiming that it alleged to have paid off the loan, and added XXXX XXXX loan to the old Countrywide loan. I never knew anything about this at all. I have never signed anything or applied for any, new loans, refinance, loan modifications, Deed, in lieu, forbearance or reverse mortgage, confirming consolidating anything with Bank of ABC. Nor have I applied for loans above with any other lenders regarding the home. Bank of ABC claims to have been paying extra home insurance on the home, Taxes, XXXX XXXX transferred loan adding taxes to this amount. The amount Im alleged to owe with Bank of ABC is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by Bank of ABC for money that I do not rightfully owe. I also recently discovered that XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX paid it off. I was never informed by my former attorneys that anything was paid off for me to have to pay it later with another lender, or servicer. XXXX XXXX had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXX Bank VA loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by XXXX XXXX in XXXX. However, this can not be confirmed. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX  Received Government Assistance Failed on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was created in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. VA secured loan. In XXXX XXXX XXXX pressured me to sign a loan Modification changing those terms of the original loan from a VA loan to a regular Mortgage without informing me of that. XXXX, XXXX also did not get any approval from the VA to change the terms of the loan which was higher well above my income amount. Which now have me in the situation Im in today. Then soon after the loan Modification was completed a Bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure less than 30 days later after alleged to have signed a subordination agreement with XXXX XXXX. Now Im in a process to be evicted from my home by alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Bank of ABC is using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to Evict me from my home. Bank of ABC also allege that I owe over XXXX to them that I know nothing about as well. I feel I have been a victim of Elder financial abuse, consumer fraud and fair debt collections act practices and mortgage foreclosure scam by hired law firm. It does appear that Bank of ABC and XXXX XXXX were working together as this is connected with the National Mortgage Settlement ( XXXX ). XXXX XXXX filed the first foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that the alleged judgment by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is invalid. The XXXX case on the home is XXXX. However, the eviction case was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. Whomever is working with alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX is still trying to pursue the Eviction case despite being dismissed for want to prosecute on XX/XX/XXXX. The Eviction case was not refiled within one year or vacated. Bank Of ABC is Threatened to sue me for debt not owed. I also have reason to believe that additional lawsuits have been filed against me By Bank of ABC or Alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX that Im not aware of. Nor was I served by anyone regarding any new lawsuits. Seeking assistance with this matter. XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. I hired an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. XXXX XXXX Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. This Bank of ABC statement says that I made payments when I have not made any of these payments to Bank of ABC. I feel that someone took out a loan in my name and identity with Bank of ABC for me to pay it back later which is fraud. Im also a victim of identity theft as well since XXXX. XXXX Page 14 - This a document that was Submitted to the XXXX with false claims that the home was vacant. When the home was not Vacant to have me restricted from accessing the home and my property removed from the home. Despite a wrongfully filed Eviction case against the home during the Illinois Eviction moratorium in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Who is really Bank of ABC? XXXX XXXX has been harassing us at the home and her husband for years. I have proof that she has been disparaging us with random people while claiming to be the realtor of the bank. Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from Bank of ABC. The Vacancy document has Bank of ABC on it as well. This is wire transfer fraud scam that wired money to my former attorney for a settlement that I did not receive any money from. This is not about the false statements by XXXX XXXX claiming the loan was paid off. The loan was forgiven for wrongdoing by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is working with Bank of ABC as well. The amount that was alleged to be paid to XXXX XXXX from Bank of ABC are totally different payment amounts. Bank of ABC has one amount and XXXX XXXX has another amount which is clearly fraud. Any payoff amount has to contain the exact same amount paid out and received. However, Bank of ABC wants me to pay them back money that was never paid to XXXX XXXX loan. Nor did I confirm anything for Bank of ABC to pay off any XXXX XXXX loan. Please look at the loan documents with my XXXX attorney 's mailing address on my statement for him to receive my pay statement only that I had no prior knowledge of. Nor did I authorize this with XXXX XXXX or my former Attorney. A lawsuit was filed in Illinois against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of ABC, Countrywide and XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX deed came from alleged Washington mutual from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX name was involved as part of a robo-signing mill transferring loans fraudulently. The FDIC records show that XXXX  XXXX was acquired by XXXX not XXXX XXXX. I have the proof and documents of all allegations. XXXX XXXX dismissed both foreclosure actions were due to wrong doing not the loan being paid off. Now in XX/XX/XXXX the stories change that Bank of ABC paid off the loan to XXXX XXXX which is false. Now Bank of ABC wants me to pay back a loan alleged to have been paid off to XXXX XXXX. I did not authorize any payoff or loans or anything with Bank of ABC which is fraud. Please review document attachments. I'm consulting with attorneys regarding fraudulent activity... XXXX XXXX continues to not answer or supply accurate information to my complaints filed. Please submit all responses to the lawsuit upload documents for review to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conceal fraud /Elder abuse. XXXX XXXX also forged my name on documents as well. The make home Affordable document from XXXX XXXX is forged and not my signature. Please review the Making Home Affordable document page 5 that the Monthly gross wages are scratched out, and the income expenses are incorrect. Not my hand writing. This is a fraudulent created document. I never signed any court affidavit or any affidavit with XXXX XXXX or any bank, confirming anyone third party or Attorney to be given access to any loan accounts documents. XXXX XXXX never confirmed anything to me to release any account documents to anyone, any attorneys and so forth. I never signed any notarized affidavit with any attorneys as well. XXXX XXXX refuses to take any accountability for there actions which was fraud against me plain and simple. This is not a duplicate complaint, because I have not received any responses. Wire Transfer statement I received from XXXX XXXX Please review the Wire payoff details that was sent by XXXX XXXX appears fraudulent. This was alleged to be paid by Bank of ABC. 1. There is no bank name on the alleged wire transfer 2. The loan amount is incorrect that was alleged to be owed to XXXX XXXX. XXXX. The file name, Load, Bank ID, Sequence and Wire Description the numbers look uneven or altered on the form. 4. No Systems notes 5. No PO information 6. No case numbers 7. XXXX XXXX is a debit card that is from Overseas The bottom line is that the alleged wire transfer form is fraudulent. Bank of ABC has not mailed any response to me. I'm requesting the reply to be sent on this Consumer Financial Protection bureau page to view as well. The site is secured.. Please review the audio. Bank of ABC is making false statements that it sent me a response which is not true While only intentionally avoiding sending the response to the Consumer Financial Protection bureau to hide fraud and Elder abuse. I'm not receiving a response from Bank of ABC. However There is an attorney name XXXX XXXX who was involved in the XXXX XXXX Case XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois. XXXX XXXX worked for a law firm called XXXX and XXXX, Now XXXX XXXX work for a different law XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be working on the XXXX case with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Then is using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX and Bank of ABC interchangeably when the two banks are not involved with one another. XXXX XXXX does not work for any of the banks and do not work for Bank of ABC, XXXX XXXX is a Decoy to cover up the fraud that happened with the XXXX XXXX case regarding the home. XXXX XXXX has also refused to provide any information as to the bank she alleges to work for. This is a fraud scam. I do not think any of my complaints are being directed to Bank of ABC at all from the Consumer Financial Protection bureau but are intercepted from being investigated by the CFPB,.

Bank of ABC/ XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX is alleged to be involved with the Old Countrywide loan from XXXX. XXXX XXXX is the alleged Senior lender. Bank of ABC/ XXXX  XXXX XXXX  XXXX  XXXX is the Alleged junior lender. Alleged to have acquired the Countrywide Home Equity line of Credit in XXXX. On the statement date of XX/XX/XXXX states Loan Buyout  from XXXX, and sold the loan by XXXX XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX charge XXXX XXXX Charge Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed foreclosure. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX alleges that the loan was paid off. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX suddenly dismisses the lawsuit which is the second foreclosure lawsuit XXXX XXXX has dismissed on the home since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX A payoff statement was ordered from alleged to be Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX sends a letter to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating congratulations the loan was paid off with a release of mortgage. XXXX XXXX has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home. I thought all the loans on the home were paid off after my wife passed away  on XX/XX/XXXX through the probate of a wrongful death. However, a Countrywide  Home Equity line of Credit was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX. My Last payment was in XXXX with the real mortgage company Countrywide  before they closed in XXXX. Out of nowhere a XXXX  XXXX XXXX  XXXX  XXXX alleges to have received assignment from Countrywide  on XX/XX/XXXX which is about 6 years after my last payment. Bank of ABC was calling me asking me to send documents regarding a previous loan with Countrywide which I did not understand why. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX filed a foreclosure on the home without my knowledge or being served in any lawsuit. XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. When I found about it the foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX it was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX stated to have no record of the home or involvement with Bank of ABC. It appears that Bank of ABC using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX as a decoy to hide Bank of ABC from any involvement or liability with the foreclosure lawsuit. In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, I also discovered that documents were forged in my name as if I made appearances in court when I was working at the VA at the time. Then I hired an attorney on XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. XXXX XXXX Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. Bank of ABC is alleging that it paid off the loan from XXXX XXXX. When it was alleged to already been sold off. Bank of ABC instead alleged to have consolidated the loan to avoid XXXX XXXX foreclosure on the home that would have wiped any second liens on the title. I dont believe any loan was actually paid off to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or Bank of ABC is refusing to produce any payment information or wire transfer as to who, when, why or where this alleged payment was made. Now Bank of ABC is claiming that it alleged to have paid off the loan, and added XXXX XXXX loan to the old Countrywide loan. I never knew anything about this at all. I have never signed anything or applied for any, new loans, refinance, loan modifications, Deed, in lieu, forbearance or reverse mortgage, confirming consolidating anything with Bank of ABC. Nor have I applied for loans above with any other lenders regarding the home. Bank of ABC claims to have been paying extra home insurance on the home, Taxes, XXXX XXXX transferred loan adding taxes to this amount. The amount Im alleged to owe with Bank of ABC is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by Bank of ABC for money that I do not rightfully owe. I also recently discovered that XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX paid it off. I was never informed by my former attorneys that anything was paid off for me to have to pay it later with another lender, or servicer. XXXX XXXX had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXX Bank VA loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by XXXX XXXX in XXXX. However, this can not be confirmed. Because XXXX  XXXX  Bank Received Government Assistance Failed on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was created in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. VA secured loan. In XXXX XXXX XXXX pressured me to sign a loan Modification changing those terms of the original loan from a VA loan to a regular Mortgage without informing me of that. XXXX, XXXX also did not get any approval from the VA to change the terms of the loan which was higher well above my income amount. Which now have me in the situation Im in today. Then soon after the loan Modification was completed a Bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX filed a foreclosure less than 30 days later after alleged to have signed a subordination agreement with XXXX XXXX. Now Im in a process to be evicted from my home by alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Bank of ABC is using the name XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Evict me from my home. Bank of ABC also allege that I owe over XXXX to them that I know nothing about as well. I feel I have been a victim of Elder financial abuse, consumer fraud and fair debt collections act practices and mortgage foreclosure scam by hired law firm. It does appear that Bank of ABC and XXXX XXXX were working together as this is connected with the National Mortgage Settlement ( XXXX ). XXXX XXXX filed the first foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that the alleged judgment by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Case XXXX is invalid. The Eviction case on the home is XXXX. However, the eviction case was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. Whomever is working with alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is still trying to pursue the Eviction case despite being dismissed for want to prosecute on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX case was not refiled within one year or vacated. Bank Of ABC is Threatened to sue me for debt not owed. I also have reason to believe that additional lawsuits have been filed against me By Bank of ABC or Alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX that Im not aware of. Nor was I served by anyone regarding any new lawsuits. Seeking assistance with this matter. XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. I hired an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. XXXX XXXX Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of ABC. XXXX XXXX claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. This Bank of ABC statement says that I made payments when I have not made any of these payments to Bank of ABC. I feel that someone took out a loan in my name and identity with Bank of ABC for me to pay it back later which is fraud. Im also a victim of identity theft as well since XXXX. Docket Page 14 - This a document that was Submitted to the Village with false claims that the home was vacant. When the home was not Vacant to have me restricted from accessing the home and my property removed from the home. Despite a wrongfully filed Eviction case against the home during the Illinois Eviction moratorium in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Who is really Bank of ABC? XXXX XXXX has been harassing us at the home and her husband for years. I have proof that she has been disparaging us with random people while claiming to be the realtor of the bank. Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from Bank of ABC. The Vacancy document has Bank of ABC on it as well. This is wire transfer fraud scam that wired money to my former attorney for a settlement that I did not receive any money from. This is not about the false statements by XXXX XXXX claiming the loan was paid off. The loan was forgiven for wrongdoing by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is working with Bank of ABC as well. The amount that was alleged to be paid to XXXX XXXX from Bank of ABC are totally different payment amounts. Bank of ABC has XXXX amount and XXXX XXXX has another amount which is clearly fraud. Any payoff amount has to contain the exact same amount paid out and received. However, Bank of ABC wants me to pay them back money that was never paid to XXXX XXXX loan. Nor did I confirm anything for Bank of ABC to pay off any XXXX XXXX loan. Please look at the loan documents with my Former attorney 's mailing address on my statement for him to receive my pay statement only that I had no prior knowledge of. Nor did I authorize this with XXXX XXXX or my former Attorney. A lawsuit was filed in Illinois against XXXX XXXX XXXX Involving Bank of ABC, Countrywide and XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX deed came from alleged XXXX  XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Notary XXXX XXXX XXXX name was involved as part of a robo-signing mill transferring loans fraudulently. The FDIC records show that XXXX  XXXX was acquired by XXXX not XXXX XXXX. I have the proof and documents of all allegations. XXXX XXXX dismissed both foreclosure actions were due to wrong doing not the loan being paid off. Now in XX/XX/XXXX the stories change that Bank of ABC paid off the loan to XXXX XXXX which is false. Now Bank of ABC wants me to pay back a loan alleged to have been paid off to XXXX XXXX. I did not authorize any payoff or loans or anything with Bank of ABC which is fraud. Please review document attachments. I'm consulting with attorneys regarding fraudulent activity... XXXX XXXX continues to not answer or supply accurate information to my complaints filed. Please submit all responses to the lawsuit upload documents for review to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conceal fraud /Elder abuse. XXXX XXXX also forged my name on documents as well. The make home Affordable document from XXXX XXXX is forged and not my signature. Please review the Making Home Affordable document page 5 that the Monthly gross wages are scratched out, and the income expenses are incorrect. Not my hand writing. This is a fraudulent created document. I never signed any court affidavit or any affidavit with XXXX XXXX or any bank, confirming anyone third party or Attorney to be given access to any loan accounts documents. XXXX XXXX never confirmed anything to me to release any account documents to anyone, any attorneys and so forth. I never signed any notarized affidavit with any attorneys as well. XXXX XXXX refuses to take any accountability for there actions which was fraud against me plain and simple. This is not a duplicate complaint, because I have not received any responses. Wire Transfer statement I received from XXXX XXXX Please review the Wire payoff details that was sent by XXXX XXXX appears fraudulent. This was alleged to be paid by Bank of ABC. 1. There is no bank name on the alleged wire transfer 2. The loan amount is incorrect that was alleged to be owed to XXXX XXXX. 3. The file name, Load, Bank ID, Sequence and Wire Description the numbers look uneven or altered on the form. 4. No Systems notes 5. No PO information 6. No case numbers 7. Maestro Exception is a debit card that is from XXXX  The bottom line is that the alleged wire transfer form is fraudulent. Bank of ABC has not mailed any response to me. I'm requesting the reply to be sent on this Consumer Financial Protection bureau page to view as well. The site is secured.. Please review the audio. Bank of ABC is making false statements that it sent me a response which is not true While only intentionally avoiding sending the response to the Consumer Financial Protection bureau to hide fraud and Elder abuse. I'm not receiving a response from Bank of ABC. \nHowever There is an attorney name XXXX XXXX who was involved in the XXXX XXXX Case XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois. XXXX XXXX worked for a law firm called XXXX XXXX  XXXX, Now XXXX XXXX work for a different law XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be working on the XXXX case with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Then is using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and Bank of ABC interchangeably when the two banks are not involved with one another. XXXX XXXX does not work for any of the banks and do not work for Bank of ABC, XXXX XXXX is a Decoy to cover up the fraud that happened with the XXXX XXXX case regarding the home. XXXX XXXX has also refused to provide any information as to the bank she alleges to work for. \n\nThis is a fraud scam. I do not think any of my complaints are being directed to Bank of ABC at all from the Consumer Financial Protection bureau but are intercepted from being investigated by the CFPB,. I ; m requesting a response from Bank of ABC Only Respectfully Submitted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XX/XX/XXXX 2022",

         "I had recently agreed with XXXX to a payment deal on my student loanl, and had already begun paying the amount agreed upon. They assured the agreement was settled and nothing could void it. They also collected the payments I had submitted. When I went to pay this month, I could no longer login on the internet to pay through the account number they had given me. When I called to pay by phone, they had told me that Navient took my debt back and sold it to another debt collector. I asked how that could be, and the man could not answer me. \n\nWhen I called Navient they said XXXX had never disclosed to them about my payment plan. When I called back XXXX, they blamed Navient and said they had told Navient about my payment plan and Navient still voided it. When I asked XXXX if Navient and them are the same organization, they said no. Thus, why did Navient take my payment plan away from XXXX, if they are not XXXX entity? No response. When I asked if Navient had the authority to do that, he curtly said no. When I asked if XXXX could fix it, he told me only Navient could, which is why I called Navient again, whom said only XXXX could. I continued to ask either party whether they were connected or under the same organization, they both denied the other, but Navient could take away my student debt payment plan after I had agreed with XXXX. It made no sense, and neither party wished to make things clearer for me because both admitted a mistake had been committed but it was \" the other 's fault ''. Moreover, all the money I had given to XXXX in monthly payments has vanished as not XXXX person has told me where that money has gone or if it went towards my debt. No one was helping me undo a mistake they both had admitted to have been done. \n\nI have called both Navient and XXXX, a few times, to try and figure what is happening and if they can help me, but, so as to not accept the wrong that has occurred, their customer service has grown meaner by each call. The first time I called each one apologized for the mix-up and blamed the other. When XXXX told me to call back because they would try to speak to Navient to fix the issue or see what they could, the man began to speak aggressively towards me and tried to deny everything he had said previously, in terms of claiming, that Navient was not supposed to cancel my payment plan from XXXX : a supposedly separate debt collection agency.Yet, he admitted that he had reported the mistake to Navient as a managerial complaint, but Navient was ignoring him. Now, I have a third debt collection agency calling me about the same debt. \n\nI feel insecure, unsafe, and incredibly distressed by the fact that XXXX debt collection agencies are fighting over my single debt that I began to pay, and no one can undo the supposed \" mistake '' of cancelling my XXXX payment plan and taking the money I paid without even reimbursing me. I would like my payment plan back, and no one at XXXX, Navient, or the XXXX collector has a clue how to help me, yet they all want me to pay on the same debt. Yet, I WAS! Each one has no idea how to proceed in this issue, and I am terrified that Navient will take my debt from anyone after a few months pay, and that money will disappear, as it currently has, and I am stuck in limbo trying to figure out what is my payment deal going forward. It is absolutely devastating to feel like your economic load might be lightening, and you have gotten ahead on paying your debts, only to be misled and treated like trash by now XXXX debt collection companies. I repeat because of Navient, with the assistance of XXXX, I have a total of XXXX debt collection agencies on me for the same student loan I was paying, and that money has not been reimbursed nor will anyone say if it has gone toward my debt. Sad, helpless, and anxious is how I feel because of how cruelly I have been spoken to, my missing money, and the lies.",

         "On or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a telephone call from Wells Fargo Bank regarding an inquiry I made about a VA Mortgage. I informed the lady that I was concerned about the repeated inquiries in my credit report but she assured me that inquiries that are dated within XXXX days apart qualify as one inquiry. I was then transferred to a XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX asked me a lot of questions regarding my financial history and questions originating from the VA Lenders ' Manual. After I answered all of the questions XXXX XXXX pulled my full credit report. I was not given an opportunity to submit a written credit application, just the verbal one with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX informed me that he pulled my credit report from all XXXX credit bureaus and that he would utilize the credit score that was in the middle. He then informed me that according to such credit score, I qualify for the VA Mortgage per VA regulations regarding the credit scores of veterans. Then, XXXX XXXX informed me that I had XXXX ( XXXX ) medical delinquencies and XXXX derogatory item from XXXX. Therefore, the Wells Fargo computer system could not pre-qualify me for the VA Mortgage. XXXX XXXX thern informed that I was required to upload documents proving my assets totalling {$5900.00}, and several other kinds of documents including explanation letters concerning the medical delinquencies and the XXXX derogatory item. I implored XXXX XXXX to supply me with a credit denial letter so that I can receive a free credit report from the XXXX ( XXXX ) credit bureaus and ascertain the nature of the XXXX derogatory item that was something new that I knew nothing about prior to XXXX XXXX 's admonishment. I believe that because XXXX XXXX could not pre-qualify me because of the XXXX derogatory item and the medical delinquencies, that such action constitutes a credit denial, even though XXXX XXXX denied that fact. Therefore, I am requesting the CFPB to compel Wells Fargo to supply me with a denial letter so that I can request a free credit report from the XXXX ( XXXX ) credit bureaus instead of repeatedly having to buy them. \nAdditionally. I believe that the credit scores that Wells Fargo received incorporate the medical delinquencies and XXXX derogatory items. It is not so clear to me which credit report included the XXXX derogatory item and which credit report displayed the middle credit score that Wells Fargo used to qualify me. It appears to me that Wells Fargo used the credit report with the lowest credit score, instead of the middle credit score, to deny me credit because it appears that is the credit report that showed the XXXX derogatory item. \nIt is also not so clear whether these medical delinquencies and derogatory item was a component of Wells Fargo FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) pre-established creditworthiness criteria that I should have been informed about prior to the accessing of my full credit reports. I do not recollect XXXX XXXX asking me and inquiring about any derogatory items in my credit reports prior to accessing them.",

         "Fact, I am a federally protected consumer, holder in due course, and the ORIGINAL creditor of the United States. \n\nFact, I applied to extend credit to me on XX/XX/XXXX year XX23 of our lord and was discriminated against upon not having that credit extended to me pursuant to the XXXX. \n\nFact, I applied for a consumer credit transaction to obtain personal property on credit. As the applicant, Pursuant to 12 CFR 1002.2 ( e ), I was applying to extend credit to me. Being you did not rightfully grant me this credit, this is an of discrimination against the consumer. \n\nFact, Pursuant to ,XX USC XX81 ( a ) ( 4 ), as the consumer I have the right to privacy. The banking system is dependent on the CRAs accurate information pursuant to XX USC XX81 ( a ) ( 1 ), being that they can cause financial hardship to the consumer. CRAs assumed a vital role of furnishing these reports, these are not government entities, so if I'm supposedly getting funds from the government why are you in need of information from a non- government entity in order to grant me my extension of credit. CRAs are simply for-profit companies who are illegally selling my information. \n\nNotice, Bank of ABC stated the information in my credit file on XXXX was the reason for the act of discrimination. This information includes : Lien, judgment, charge-off, or settled account. Applicant Number of major derogatory accounts and/or public records. XXXX XXXX. XXXX - XXXX derog. - delq/public records to all trades ratio. Applicant Insufficient recent satisfactory credit history or no credit file. Applicant Fact, The accounts that are being reported on XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, have already been disputed and removed with XXXX. Those are not my debts. This is why its vital for them to report accurately due to banks depending so heavily on these reports. \n\nThe two charge off accounts are also inaccurate information being reported on my credit. Firstly, they are charged off as profit and loss and they get a tax write off for these said accounts. Secondly, XXXX finance unlawfully collected on an extension of my credit in violation of XX USC 891-894. We are now in arbitration but I can not discuss the details. \n\nNotice, XXXX is also in violation of the FDCPA and should not be reporting on my file. All of these said accounts are NOT reporting in the negative amount so what debt do I owe? This is inaccurate information. These accounts were already paid for when they released my securities to them. \n\nMy social security number to my knowledge is a trust account connected to the Federal Reserve, and me being a federally protected consumer and original creditor of the United States. XXXX and XXXX are taking money out of my account when I indorsed the notes/instruments pursuant to UCC 3-104 ). I signed the notes in order for them to release securities and grant the extension of credit. The indorsement, pursuant to UCC 8-102 ( 11 ), on the notes were communicated, pursuant to UCC 8-102 ( 6 ), to a clearing corporation, pursuant to UCC 8-102 ( 5 ) to release such securities on my behalf. Proof of this is the inquiry on my XXXX file that is the receipt of this XXXX Fact, All said accounts are being inaccurately reported. An account pursuant to 12 CFR 1002.2 ( a ) is an extension of credit. Which is proof they are extorting me and trying to unlawfully collect on an extension of credit they already granted to me as the consumer. \n\nNotice, I dont have any recent credit transaction history because of discrimination like this. I cant be at fault for discrimination. Reporting agencies are causing me financial harm as a federally protected consumer and original creditor. \n\nFurthermore, all of the information you mentioned to be the reason of this act of discrimination are inaccurate! I can not lawfully owe any debt and anyone trying to collect on all unlawful debts will/ and are being held personally liable. The dollar is not backed by anything and our gold standard has been taken away from us so I can not pay any alleged debts. \n\nNotice that the letter Bank of ABC sent me on XX/XX/XXXX year XX23 of our lord is proof of adverse action pursuant to 12 CFR 1002.2 ( c ). You discriminated against me and did not approve my application requesting to extend credit to means you failed/never tried to make me a counter offer. \n\nIve submitted an application, pursuant to 12 CFR 1002.2f, to extend my credit to me.This, to my understanding, was to be treated as a consumer credit transaction ( XX USC XX79a ( 2 ). Being that I am an applicant pursuant to 12 CFR 1002.2 ( E ) Im requesting an extension of my credit. How can I lawfully be denied extension of my own credit? 12 CFR 1002.2 ( h ) defines Consumer credit as credit EXTENDED to a natural person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, in this case a car. \n\nFact, this is a violation of XX USC XX11 being that Bank of ABC gave me false information. you are willingly and knowingly denying me extension of my own credit. \n\nIn addition, an extension to something thats already in place or existing, correct? Meaning this credit is already granted to me. I'm simply expressing my rights and applying for the credit to be EXTENDED and Im being discriminated against.\n\nIve submitted my credit card ( 12 CFR 1002.2k ), in this case my social security number, information online on the application in order to receive and purchase a car on consumer credit ( 12 CFR 1002.2h ) for personal and household use, so there is no reason I should have been denied. I have the right to apply for credit and be granted that credit to be extended to me, which is what I am trying to do but I am unlawfully being denied that right. Anyone who violates me can and will be held personally liable for each violation.. \n\nPlease lawfully show me where Im legally able to be denied the extension of my own credit by any financial institution. To my understanding Banks do not have the ability to loan money, banks purchase notes from consumers. I am the consumer and original creditor so I cant pay any debt, I extend credit. The one who pays the debt, according to XXXX is the one who holds the XXXX, and the Constitution states debts can only be paid by gold. Being they took away our gold standard and means to pay debt, it is their obligation pursuant to XX USC 8. Additionally, Public Law : \" Chap. 48, 48 Stat. 112 also states the Federal government pays for every debt dollar for dollar. \n\nOn the last paragraph of page one of the letter Bank of ABC sent to me is a statement referring to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act stating you can not discriminate against me. As stated you are in violation of discrimination due to me expressing my rights to have credit extended to me upon applying for a consumer credit application. Also I want to note Bank of ABC is insured by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, and they are in violation of the FDIC.",

         "I lost XXXX Reward Points on my Us Bank XXXX card in XXXX. When I applied for the card there was no indication that the points would expire in five years. I have a copy of a credit card offer from that period before the CFPB ( forwarded by mail ). I do all my banking on line but receive a paper statement that I file for taxes. US Bank Customer Service said that because I elect to receive paper statements US Bank was under no obligation no notify me on line or by email or account alert of the loss of points. If informed, I could have received {$790.00} cash reward. In XXXX, I never checked the REWARDS web site. I was saving my XXXX points for a dream trip to XXXX once my husband completed his XXXX. Obviously if I knew that there was a five year limit on REWARDS, I would have taken the {$790.00} check.. Also, if US Bank had stated that their points expired in five years, I would have used US Bank points for a trip in XXXX rather XXXX XXXX . In XXXX, US Bank sent a two big sleek brochures of their REWARDS program and my points as of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX but in all the fine print never said I would lose XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX on XXXX if I did not use the points now. ( I will send a copy by mail ). Customer Service claims that the five year limit must have been listed in some rules I received in XXXX or XXXX but said a copy of those rules was not available on the US Bank web site. I have checked with all the major credit card company 's ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX etc ) and none of them have a time limit on rewards. I think I was completely reasonable to be shocked that US Bank would take XXXX points from me. One US Bank Customer Service agent said that I would have been notified by email If only I had given up my right to a paper statement .Another Customer Service representative said that even though my email was on my profile, I had not given them permission to email me any notifications. Another Customer Service Representative said I was responsible because I had not set up an alert for my rewards. A supervisor in technical support said it was not possible to set up an alert on rewards points expiring. He also said that I was receiving the same Account Summary and XX0 day list of purchases when I went on line whether I had requested paper statement or not. He said I would have to go to the REWARDS SCREEN to get any information on my rewards expiring or search out my original statement and download it to a new file.. I had no reason to go to REWARDS SCREEN because I could not take a trip in XXXX because of my husbands XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I checked the REWARDS SCREEN to purchase an airlines ticket for my granddaughter and found that had lost XXXX miles in XXXX. I was in total disbelief. After contacting XXXX major credit card companies, I found that rewards points do not expire among the industry leaders. At that point I looked at my statements for XXXX and found that on my XXXX XXXX Statement there was one line in a XXXX page statement : Points Expiring on XXXX. This warning was not available on the main screen. I would have had to download the statement to a Document File. Most customers using the online site would never download the actual statement and would miss this warning and others that followed. CFPB has made a gigantic improvement in the way credit card companies divulge information to consumers. I think that the REWARDS programs are not yet covered by CFPB. If the REWARDS program was covered, US BANK would have to clearly state on a credit application the FIVE year limit on Rewards and notify customers on the main computer screen when points expire. No rational person looses {$790.00} when they can get a cash reward by just asking!!!",

TOTAL NONSENSE!!! \n\nSHOW ME A CURRENT VALID CONTRACT WITH MY WET INK SIGNATURE!!! \nSHOW IT TO ME!!!! AND STOP XXXX AROUND WITH YOUR TACTICTS OF CRIMINAL DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR, THAT AINT MY XXXX DEBT AND YOU KNOW IT!!! \n\nPARTS OF A LAWFUL CONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. \n2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. \n3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the \" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. \n4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. \n5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. \n6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds \" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. \n7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. \n8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties. \n\nXX U.S. Code 78cc - Validity of contracts Current through Pub.

         "I would like to start off by first saying that it has been a long XXXX months. I have been trying to get out of my vehicle but no one has tried to even help me. I first tried to get into a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was such a beautiful car. I had a down payment of {$350.00} plus a trade in that I still owe. At first the manager and the salesman said that I had the car and to go ahead and put insurance on it. So I went to get insurance on it with the XXXX lady. I found out that the insurance was cheaper on the XXXX than my current car. I was really happy and excited then. The manager then tells me to come back in the morning to pick up my new car. He said he was working with one of the banks that he knew to get me a good financing rate. He said I would need a co-signer. I have never in my life had a co-signer. So I thought that was weird. I knew I had good credit because I have always paid my loans back and XXXX car note paid off. So I was excited to get into this beautiful car because I love cars so much. And also people who love cars knows that XXXX XXXX makes very fine automobiles. I tell my friends about it and couldnt wait to be in it. Then the next day I go into the dealership I was excited. But the bad news was we couldnt help you get it. So I was upset. They said I needed a co-signer. I never in my life had to have a co-signer before. I never checked my credit score to know either. But then I applied for a personal loan at a credit union bank. They approved the loan for {$XX00.00} for XXXX years. With great financing. They arent making much on me in those two years. After all is said and done they are only making {$XX0.00} dollars off me. Great people. This reminds me I have to make a payment with them. Anyways the beautiful lady said my credit score was a XXXX and that was good. So after that I tried to apply for other cars all around XXXX. I had a lot of inquiries from different dealerships trying to get out my car. They all said that I needed a co-signer or I didnt meet the credit standards. But I knew I had a good credit rating. So I never stopped trying and I finally found out that it hurt my credit score for each inquiry. The lady that gave me the loan at the bank told me that. So I continued to try because I wanted out this car and also because the first dealership told me that I would have car trouble soon. They wanted me to buy a new car. I have went to just about every dealership in XXXX and no one could help me. One salesman even went as far as adding what I owe on the car to a brand new car. That made the XXXX model the same price as a XXXX model with high interest rate. And expected me to buy it and think it as being fair. With adding no incentives or rebates. Saying I did not qualify for the program. He even said that you know that you are insane. Going everywhere and expecting a different result. No one helped me get into a new car I wanted. Even going to the next state over didnt help me. The people that were at the first dealership where I wanted the XXXX XXXX had now moved to that state. They also have others here in XXXX as well. I love cars and always will. All the dealerships in XXXX, Georgia made it like it was impossible to get a new car. I had deals on a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX Coupe from some lenders that CarMax goes through and I didnt even know because no one at CarMax even tried to contact me about it. So now I am still in the same car. I found out that XXXX rotor needs replacing and that it has been cut a few times and it just needs a new one totally. I didnt even know that. I trusted Carmax and their XXXX point inspection. But they lie so much. My car history shows no accidents.

         "I APPLIED FOR MY 2ND BANK OF ABC CREDIT CARD IN XX/XX/XX23. I ALREADY HAVE A CURRENT CREDIT CARD WITH THE BANK THAT I APPLIED FOR YEARS AGO AND WAS APPROVED. HOWEVER WITH THIS APPLICATION, I WAS SENT A LETTER IN THE MAIL, ASKING FOR MY SOCIAL SECURITY # & INCOME INFORMATION TO BE SENT VIA ALL PLACES, REGULAR POSTAL MAIL. THIS IN ITSELF IS BAFFELING TO ME AS WHY, IF I HAVE A CURRENT CREDIT CARD WITH THEM I WOULD NEED TO STILL VERIFY MY SS #? IT HASNT CHANGED!!! BUT I DONT EVEN MIND HAVING TO SEND THE INFORMATION IN, IN ORDER TO GET APPROVED FOR A NEW ACCT, BUT WHAT I DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IS THE MEANS BANK OF ABC IS ASKING ME TO SEND IN THIS INFORMATION!! \nSO LET ME SEE IF I GOT THIS RIGHT ( ROLLS EYES AS IM TYPING ) ...... \nBANK OF ABC IS TRYING TO VERIFY MY INFORMATION TO ENSURE ITS ME REALLY APPLYING AND THAT ITS NOT A FRAUDULENT APPLICATION... .. ( SO OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TRYING TO PREVENT FRAUD ) ... ..BUT THEY ASK FOR AN APPLICANT TO SEND, THRU THE MAIL, WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS THE MAIL IS NOTORIOUS FOR LOSING MAIL, CARRIERS STEALING & OPENING MAIL & MAIL BEING DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS!! ( JUST THIS PAST FRIDAY, I HAD TO DO A \" RETURN TO SENDER '' BECAUSE THE POST OFFICE INCORRECTLY MISDELIVERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE ANOTHER PERSONS BANKING & CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS TO MY HOME INSTEAD OF TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENT!! ) ..... ( EYE ROLL STILL IN PLACE ) YOU WOULD THINK A BIG BANK SUCH AS BANK OF ABC WOULD HAVE A MORE SECURE PROCESS IN ORDER TO HAVE DATA SENSITIVE INFORMATION SENT IN!! LIKE TO A SECURE FAX, VIA UPLOAD OR EVEN A SECURE EMAIL! BUT TO EXPECT, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, TO HAVE A CUSTOMER/NEW APPLICANT SEND THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THRU \" SNAIL '' MAIL IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!! NOT TO MENTION THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR THE POST OFFICE TO DELIVER MAIL! I HAVE THE LETTER FROM BANK OF ABC REQUESTING MY SS # & PAYSTUB THAT IS DATED, XX/XX/XX23 THAT I JUST RECEIVED TODAY!! XX/XX/XX23!! THAT I AM EXPECTED TO RETURN BACK TO THEM, NO LATER THAN 30 CALENDER ( NOT EVEN BUSINESS DAYS )!!!!! THAT AGAIN, I JUST GOT ON XX/XX/XXXX!!!! HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE FOR A BIG BANK TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THIS MANNER!!! \n\nMAYBE THEY NEED TO START A DEPT ( WHICH I AM HAPPY TO HEAD IF THEY ARE IN NEED OF HELP IN DOING SO! AS I AM ALWAYS LOOKING TO INCREASE MY MONEY BY HAVING MULTIPLE STREAMS OF INCOME. SERIOUSLY BANK OF ABC. I WOULD TRUELY OPEN TO DISCUSSING A PAYING POSITION TO HEAD THIS DEPARTMENT. NO BENEFITS NECESSARY AS I HAVE THOSE ALREADY ) THAT IS DEDICATED TO RECEIVING & REVIEWING DOCUMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO COME IN THAT CAN BE SENT BY SECURE FAX, EMAIL, UPLOAD!! ( LIKE OTHER BANKS SUCH AS XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ... JUST TO NAME A FEW ... .. OF WHICH I HAVE CREDIT CARDS WITH ALL OF THESE BANKS & HAVE NEVER ONCE BEEN ASKED TO SEND IN DOCUMENTATION VIA REGULAR MAIL! I EVEN JUST RECENTLY CLOSED ON MY HOME LOAN WITH AN APPRAISED VALUE OF OVER $ XXXX! AND NOT ONCE DID I HAVE TO SEND ANYTHING THRU REGULAR MAIL! IT WAS ALL DONE VIA SECURE DOCUMENT UPLOAD/FAX/EMAIL! SO YOUR TELLING ME SENDING DOCUMENTS FOR A CREDIT CARD CANT BE DONE THIS WAY????? ( INSERT, SMIRK EMOJI, SLAPS FOREHEAD EMOJI & EYE ROLL EMOJI )! \n\nAND WHAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK IS THIS???? WHY, IF, EVERYTIME I CALL ABOUT MY CURRENT CREDIT CARD, I HAVE TO VERIFY MY INFORMATION & MAKE SURE ITS ME, BY HAVING A CODE SENT TO ME VIA A \" TEXT OR PHONE CALL '' SUFFICIENT ENOUGH OR BANK OF ABC WILL SEND YOU A TEXT/CALL YOU TO ENSURE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS ARE TRANSACTIONS ACTUALLY BEING MADE BY THEIR CUSTOMERS, BUT THOSE METHODS ARE NOT VALID FOR A NEW APPLICATION? ESPECIALLY WHEN THE NEW APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED THRU MY CURRENT ALREADY ESTABLISHED BANK OF ABC ONLINE ACCOUNT ACCESS??!! \n\nPLEASE!! CAN SOMEBODY/ANYBODY AT BANK OF ABC MAKE ANY OF THIS APPLICATION FOOLISHNESS MAKE SENSE!!??????????\n\nSIGNED- A BANK OF ABC CURRENT CUSTOMER W/ A XXXX CREDIT SCORE",

         "Hello, This complaint is about my Bank of ABC XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card ending in XXXX. \nMy XXXX XXXX loyalty number is XXXX I'd like to start off saying that I didn't want to file this complaint on Bank of ABC . I LIKE Bank of ABC. I like their website and I like going to the branch. I don't want to have a problem with Bank of ABC. I have a business account there also and I intend to keep it there. I really wish I didn't have to do this. \n\nThis is actually a very simple problem, but I can't seem to get anyone at Bank of ABC to even UNDERSTAND the problem no matter how many times I call or explain it to them. \n\nI filed two cases : Case # 1 : XXXX Case # 2 : XXXX The reason I filed a second case is that I received a letter with the first case number telling me that they had resolved the issues. The issues were not all resolved. All but one issue remains outstanding. \n\nMy offer for my card that was approved on XX/XX/XX23 was as follows : XXXX XP ( experience points ) upon card approval ( NOT RECEIVED ) {$100.00} statement credit ( RECEIVED ) XXXX XXXX miles ( RECEIVED ) An additional XXXX XP ( experience points ) bonus ( RECEIVED ) I've received everything except the XXXX XP that I should have received upon approval. I simply got nothing. In looking at my XXXX statement, one can clearly see that the XXXX miles was issued and the XXXX XP \" subsequent bonus '' points were issued, but I never got the XXXX XP upon card approval. \n\nWhy is this so hard for people to figure out? \n\nPlease look at my screenshots and please issue me the XXXX XP. I should be silver status right now for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I thought this would have happened by now and it hasn't - because the terms on my credit card were not fully honored. I recently even flew XXXX ( boarding pass attached ) and I had to forfeit a lot of benefits because I wasn't a silver level member. I should have already been a silver. \n\nTHE SCREENSHOTS AND THE XXXX STATEMENT ARE SELF-EXPLANATORY. \n\nI'm sorry that I had to file this complaint. \nI hope that Bank of ABC doesn't retaliate because I really do like them. \nPlease don't resent me as a customer for filing this complaint. Believe me, I've tried to explain it several times over the phone, and each time there is some kind of erroneous conclusion to my issue. \nBest regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX",

         "To Whom It May Concern, My name is XXXX XXXX. I have Chase Freedom credit card from Chase Bank. The Chase Freedom credit card comes with a card holder benefit that you can earn 5 % cashback bonus on certain spending categories each month offered by the Chase Bank. \nI have signed up the 5 % cashback bonus program for XX/XX/XXXX that includes spending at Supermarkets XX/XX/XXXX. I have XXXX Chase Freedom credit cards and I have always signed them up at the same time. \nUnder the impression that I am eligible to earn 5 % cash back on spending at the Supermarkets, I have used one of Chase Freedom credit card for all my spending at all Supermarkets that I shop for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. But I did not see any cash back bonus earned on my credit card statement for these months. I finically made a phone call to Chase Bank questioning about my eligible 5 % cash back bonus, and to my shook they told me the only credit card that I signed up for the second quarter cash back bonus program is the one that I did not use at the Supermarkets and the credit card that I did use at the Supermarkets was never signed up for the program at all! \nWhat more troubling to me is this is not the first time that had happened with my Chase Freedom credit card that they claim I did not sign up the cash back bonus program and all my eligible spending were excluded from it. Chase Bank used to send out a confirmation email to the customer when they sign up for the quarterly cash back bonus program, but they have stopped doing that for the past few years. The only way consumer can verify their sign up status is view through Chase account online. \nI am like most of consumers do not do a screen print when you signed up the cash back bonus program, and that is where I believe the Chase bank had engaged in targeting certain high spending consumers who signed up the program, but do not provide them with any confirmation then later remove them from the program to eliminate their eligible cash back bonus and to boost the bank profits at same time. \nI believe I am not the only victim that had fall into their traps, and it has become a new tactic for Chase Bank to boost their profits by cheating on consumers like me. I believe Chase Bank 's actions have constituted a fraud and it worth further investigations by the Federal Government. \nSincerely XXXX XXXX",

         "On XX/XX/XXXX my husband, XXXX, responded to an offer to purchase an I-pad for {$XX.00}. He gave them his credit card number, email address and home address. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we received our Bank of ABC ( BofA ) credit card statement in the mail and noticed that a charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX from a company called XXXX  out of Texas and another charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX from a company called XXXX out of XXXX for {$110.00}. XXXX called XXXX about the {$110.00} charge and found out it was a vitamin supplement company. Their representative gave him another number to call and that person referred him to their \" support '' website. XXXX knew he was getting the run around, so we filed a fraud complaint with Bank of ABC over the phone and included both charges because neither XXXX of us ever ordered any supplements from either company. At the time, I do not believe we connected it with the ordering of the I-pad. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of ABC sent a denial letter stating the merchant, XXXX claimed the {$110.00} was a subscription or re-occuring bill and that we were repeat customers. I called the company and they said XXXX ordered through some sweepstakes contest, but they couldn't help me since BofA was handling the dispute. The representative said that she would make a note in the file that we didn't order any products from them and never received any products from them On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BofA explaining that I thought the 2 charges were somehow related and reiterated that neither one of us ordered, nor received supplements from either company. It was my opinion that the first charge for {$XX.00} from XXXX sold XXXX 's information and credit card number to the second company, XXXX which is a company in another state. The dispute for {$110.00} was reopened. The {$XX.00} charge was still pending at the time. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, We received a denial from BofA for the {$110.00} charge.The company, XXXX, submitted a receipt that said we ordered 1 product for {$110.00} ( no description of product, just says product qty 1 ) and no shipping information ( how shipped, shipping tracking number, etc ). Bank of ABC therefore denied our claim saying that was proof we received the merchandise. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Called to explain the situation and dispute again. The Representative just chastised me for falling for a scam. Was very condescending so I gave up talking to him. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Called Fraud and re-explained what happened. Reiterated that the only order made was for an I-pad for {$XX.00} that never came, and we never ordered nor received any supplements or ipads. Case was put in dispute again. Rep said the {$XX.00} charge was still pending. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Received letter from BofA denying dispute again for {$110.00} stating giving the reason that I granted access to an authorized user on my credit card, thereby I have to accept responsibility and that the home address, phone number or email address matches what the merchant has on file. If XXXX ordered and received a product, I do accept responsibility. In fact, I believe I stated in the next call to BofA that if anything, we were responsible for the {$XX.00} charge since XXXX placed an order. However I felt that since we still didn't receive any I-pad, it would still be a dispute for a product ordered, but not received. This denial in my opinion did not address the dispute or act of fraud in any way. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX - I called BofA and explained the situation again and the XXXX suggested I file the ordering of the laptop as a billing dispute instead of fraud ( which I now found out that BofA considers to be a totally different department ). I told the rep I felt it was both a fraud related and a billing dispute. I felt the whole thing was fraudulent since we never ordered supplements. It was also a billing dispute, since we were being charged for products we never received ( nor ordered ). She said we couldn't claim both and suggested combining both claims into XXXX as they seemed to be related. I agreed. I asked to speak to the person who decides the case, but was told that BofA only allows customers to talk to Associates. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was told no one was available now, so she took my number and said a supervisor would call me back. No one ever did, so I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to find out about late fees and interest since my bill for the {$110.00} in disputed charges was due that Monday and BofA wouldn't hold off billing me on the disputed charges. I felt I was forced to pay the minimum amount so I wouldn't incur a late penalty. \n\nReceived a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they resolved my claim for {$XX.00} ( which was 113 days from my original dispute for that claim ) and that they resolved that dispute in my favor. No explanation. On the same date, they declined the dispute for the {$110.00} charge because it was made by an authorized user. This is so frustrating because this answer does not address the complaint/dispute which I have stated in numerous conversations with BofA reps XXXX and they seem to agree with me when they opened and re-opened the disputes. But when it gets to the fraud team, they just don't understand so I will summarize below. \n\nI maintain the dispute to be as follows : 1 ) XXXX ordered an I-pad on XX/XX/XXXX for {$XX.00}. While he can recall the amount, he does not recall, the company name. He has not received an i-pad to date. \n2 ) BofA credit card statement revealed 2 charges. XXXX for {$XX.00} and another for {$110.00}. Both companies seem to sell supplements. Neither XXXX nor I ordered supplements, so I disputed the charges immediately. \n2 ) It seems the second merchant ( not sure if same merchant or not since different names and different states ) told BofA that we are \" existing customers '', but have provided no proof that we are existing customers who have ordered products from them in the past, nor have they provided proof that they shipped us anything. \n3 ) We maintain that neither one of us have ever received/nor ordered any supplements or products from either company ( the receipt sent to us only says product ), nor have we received an i-pad. \n\nWhile most of the BofA Reps have been friendly and seem to understand the situation, and dare I say seem to agree the transactions were fraudulent, when it gets to the fraud division, things seem lost in translation. I tried everything possible to get BofA to reverse the charges BEFORE they paid either merchant. These merchants are so blatantly fraudulent and a scam, which we didn't realize until after we got our statement with the charges. BofA was negligent in protecting us as their customer. \n\nI would like to add, that I have no documents except those that BofA sent me, since we did not order any supplements from either merchant, nor did we receive any products. The merchants have not sent us anything at all.",

         "I had previously filed a complain ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX \" From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, three separate, unauthorized transactions were made through my Bank of ABC bank account XXXX An unknown checking account was linked to my bank account and transferred three separate amounts : XX/XX/XXXX : Transfer of {$XX00.00} XX/XX/XXXX : Transfer of {$1XX0.00} XX/XX/XXXX : Transfer of {$XX00.00} A total of {$4800.00} was withdrawn from my account without my consent or authorization to an unknown entity. I have no information on the account number, or who it belongs to, as the moment fraud was detected, I was advised to immediately delete the linked account and change email/password. This is a widespread problem for Bank of ABC, and hundreds of thousands are having the same problem of foreign entities withdrawing money without their authorization. Hindsight, at this point, is irrelevant. The issue is the way Bank of ABC refuses to give victims their money back. I filed a dispute earlier this month, and received a letter telling me that there were 'no errors ' found and that my claim was closed. Once again, hundreds of thousands are being told the same thing, and are having their money held hostage. People 's livelihoods are at stake and Bank of ABC refuses to do thorough investigations into this matter, and give victims what belongs to them. I was also told that, if no resolution were found in ten days, I would receive a credit to my account, but this did not happen ( this is besides the point, however ). '' On XX/XX/XXXX Bank of ABC responded ( paraphrased ). with \" One time passcodes were sent to the email, so no errors were found '' and I was denied. I received the official notice in the mail about a week later and found oiut. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of ABC and told a representative about my case and told them that NO one time passcodes were sent to my email to confirm these fraudulent transfers. I demanded, at the very least, that I be told the account number and routing number of where my money was transferred to so I could move forward with an attorney, since Bank of ABC has been negligent. Not only did I provide a police report, FBI report, CFPB complain - but I also sent personal bank statements of the given months to prove that these funds never went into my bank account. After all this, I was still denied, so I figured there was nothing else to do, but to move forward myself with a lawsuit. \n\nThe representative told me that she could not provide me with the information I was asking for and transferred me to a different person. Two and a half hours and 7 transfers later, I got to speak with the supposed supervisor of the escalations/claims department ( XXXX from Kentucky ) XXXX For the XXXX time that day, I told her what was happening and asked for the account and routing numbers. To my dismay, she responded the same way the others had and told me she could not provide me with that. She did, however, give me the last four digits associated with the fraudulent transfers, along with emails and a phone number. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX My suspicion was correct - my email was changed to the criminal 's so THEY would receive the XXXX and verify the transfer. Besides the blatant fraud, why Bank of ABC negligently decided to overlook this is beyond me, XXXX assured me that these documents would be mailed to me so I could reopen my case. She said to call by next week if I hadn't received them. \n\nI called the following week and was told to \" wait ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called once again and was reassured and told to \" wait '', as they were on their way. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, and asked how long I would have to wait to receive these documents. I was told \" Wait 7-10 business days - you'll receive them in the mail. '' Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called and voiced my frustrations with a representative and asked if I was going to receive the documents or I was just being played with. The representative had no idea what I was talking about and told me \" we don't do that here '', in regards to sending over the documents with the information I was verbally told. She asked me why I didn't just reopen my claim, and I let her know that I wasn't going to waste my time reopening a case if my previous evidence wasn't enough, and that it was my word against theirs with the information that was given to me ( account numbers & emails ). \n\nI was on hold for about twenty minutes as she looked into my account. After the hold, she said she would reopen my claim. I have never had as much transparency with Bank of ABC as I have with her. She told me that she probably shouldn't be telling me, but there was so much blatant fraud during these transfers ( phone calls with with missed security questions, wrong name, etc. ) and so many red flags, that she didn't know why these things were blatantly overlooked. The rep herself agreed that this was 100 %, blatant fraud and told me she hopes that I will finally get my stolen money back 1XX days later, I somehow doubt i'm going to get my money back. I retract my previous word usage of 'negligent ' to describe Bank of ABC XXXX The more appropriate word is criminal. This money is being held hostage and its apparent they're going out of their way to prevent it from getting out of their hands. Blatant lies upon lies, and so much wasted time on their part has resulted in such a negative impact on my life from the dire need of the money I haven't been able to recuperate.\n\nI'm using the CFPB, not as a beacon of home that this will somehow get me my {$4800.00} back, but as an affidavit. The next logical step is to move forward to litigation, but that's not enough for me. I'm going to send this to media outlets, along with the comptroller of state. If restitution isn't paid to me, at the very least the satisfaction of exposing Bank of ABC 's criminal behavior will suffice. Unfortunately, I'm not the only person this has been done to ( backed up by lawsuits in the past two years ) and I won't be the last. Godspeed to anybody trying to deal with the criminality of Bank of ABC.",

         "B of A Fraud Claim - {$5000.00} I am once again reaching out to the CFPB requesting assistance on my {$5000.00} fraud claim. Bank of ABC continues to deny this claim with the only stated reason being no posting error has occurred. I feel strongly that B of A is in violation of Regulation E with regards to this claim and possibly many other similar claims. I ask that the CFPB review the facts of this claim, and similar outstanding and unresolved claims against B of A and consider appropriate enforcement action. At least one prior class action claim confirmed that B of A has been negligent in their handling of similar claims and I ask that the CFPB hold them accountable as they continue to disregard their customers rights and their own responsibilities as custodian of our accounts. \nThe facts of my claim are as follows : On Friday, XX/XX/XX22, a {$5000.00} transfer was initiated by someone unknown to me to an account at another bank also unknown to me. I had not provided my card, PIN, or password, to any other person and had not authorized any person to use my card or initiate a transaction. This transaction on XX/XX/XX22, was the first of two unauthorized transfers initiated on this account. \nOn Sunday, XX/XX/XX22, I discovered the fraudulent transfer and notified B of A of the details at about XXXX XXXX that day, less than two full business days after the transaction was initiated. I was able to provide the bank representative with the routing number and last 4 digits of the account number the {$5000.00} was transferred to. I was confident that the bank could stop the transfer and possibly take action against the perpetrator as the funds would not have been deposited to the receiving account until at least Monday, XX/XX/XX22. It appears that the bank did nothing to stop this transfer or identify the person/account that received those funds. \nOn XX/XX/XX22, there was a second transfer initiated for {$XX00.00}. I fortunately discovered that transfer on the same day it was initiated. I contacted B of A and the receiving bank, based on the routing number, and alerted both banks of the fraudulent transfer in process. In the end, that second fraudulent transfer attempt failed with no loss to me. \nBased on the details I could see that the two transactions were identical in how they were processed. In both cases the bank transfer data screen in my account was somehow populated with a routing number and account number without my knowledge and apparently without triggering any alerts at B of A. In both cases the transfers were initiated two days after larger than normal credits had been posted to the account resulting in a larger than usual current balance. The person initiating these transfers must have had access to transaction level detail in order to time the transfers accurately and for amounts that largely depleted the account. The perpetrator also either had access to the bank system or in some way was able to access my account without my knowledge. There were no signs such as changes to my password or other information that indicated someone had stolen my account or identity. The only irregularities were the two transfers initiated on XX/XX/XX22, and XX/XX/XX22. Based on the number of similar complaints reported to the CFPB by other cardholders it is clear this was not an isolated issue. Shortly after XX/XX/XX22, B of A issued me a replacement card that included increased security such as chip technology. I believe B of A made this change, increasing card security, due to the high volume of fraudulent activity they were experiencing on similar accounts. There has been no suspicious activity on this account since that updated card was issued. \nOver the months between XX/XX/XX22, and today I have had numerous interactions with B of A customer service representatives. While they always had to refer the issue to the Fraud Department they were, without exception, sympathetic regarding my loss and indicated that they were dealing with a high volume of fraudulent claims. During an XX/XX/XX22, call the B of A representative explained that my claim had initially been incorrectly coded by the bank. She requested that I change the email and security information on my account, which I did while on the phone, and she then confirmed to me that the claim would be treated as fraudulent and the {$5000.00} would be returned to my account. The bank did not honor that commitment. \nIn XXXX a different bank representative asked that I file a police report with the local police department as it would add further support in characterizing the claim as fraudulent. I did file a report at B of As request and forwarded it to the bank. Once again the bank did nothing as far as I can tell. \n\nB of A is in violation of Regulation E.\n\nRegulation E Section 1005.2 ( m ) defines an unauthorized transfer as : ( m ) Unauthorized electronic fund transfer means an electronic fund transfer from a consumer 's account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit. \n\nThis exactly describes the transaction that resulted in my {$5000.00} loss. It was a transfer from my account initiated by someone other than me that did not have authority to initiate the transfer and I have received no benefit from the transfer.\n\nRegulation E Section 1005.6 addresses consumer liability : 1005.6 Liability of consumer for unauthorized transfers. \n( b ) Limitations on amount of liability. A consumer 's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer or a series of related unauthorized transfers shall be determined as follows : 1. Application of liability provisions. There are three possible tiers of consumer liability for unauthorized EFTs depending on the situation. A consumer may be liable for : ( 1 ) up to {$50.00} ; ( 2 ) up to {$500.00} ; or ( 3 ) an unlimited amount depending on when the unauthorized EFT occurs. More than one tier may apply to a given situation because each corresponds to a different ( sometimes overlapping ) time period or set of conditions.\n\n2. Consumer negligence. Negligence by the consumer can not be used as the basis for imposing greater liability than is permissible under Regulation E. Thus, consumer behavior that may constitute negligence under state law, such as writing the PIN on a debit card or on a piece of paper kept with the card, does not affect the consumer 's liability for unauthorized transfers. ( However, refer to comment 2 ( m ) -2 regarding termination of the authority of given by the consumer to another person. ) 3. Limits on liability. The extent of the consumer 's liability is determined solely by the consumer 's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of an access device. Similarly, no agreement between the consumer and an institution may impose greater liability on the consumer for an unauthorized transfer than the limits provided in Regulation E.\n\n1 ) Timely notice given. If the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days after learning of the loss or theft of the access device, the consumer 's liability shall not exceed the lesser of {$50.00} or the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur before notice to the financial institution. \n\nI notified B of A on Sunday, XX/XX/XX22, of the unauthorized transfer initiated on XX/XX/XX22. This is less than two business days from the transaction date and on the same business day that I learned of the transaction. My loss should not exceed {$50.00} per Regulation E.\n\nB of As stated reason for denying my claim is no posting error has occurred on your account. I suppose they could say that they were simply following the transfer instructions initiated on XX/XX/XX22. While this might be true, they are ignoring the fact that those instructions were fraudulent and not initiated or approved by me and not for the benefit of me or anyone connected to me. Perhaps they see this as no error but that is not the point. They processed a transaction that was fraudulent from the start, reported as fraudulent, and reported in a timely fashion per regulation E. The errors that did occur were errors committed by the bank. Their system allowed a person to access my account and initiate this transfer. And then, once notified, there is no evidence that the bank took any steps to stop or suspend the transfer or to identify the perpetrator of this fraud. It appears that the bank did nothing, abdicating their responsibility as a service provider and custodian of my account. So yes, there were errors related to this transaction, errors by the bank. \nIn reviewing CFPB complaints filed against B of A for similar accounts and transactions from XX/XX/XX22 through XX/XX/XX22 I find a list of 98 complaints from California customers. In reviewing the detail I see that many are virtually identical to the fact pattern of my claim. That is a claim that someone unknown to the account holder somehow initiated a transfer to another bank account. These are not isolated problems. In reading the complaints I see that the bank is often accused of treating the customer as the criminal. I feel the same way. Being a responsible professional over a long career it is insulting for the bank to accuse me of submitting a false claim. I can see that many other cardholders feel the same. I can not think of a better example of horrible customer service which results in frustration along with a significant financial loss to the customer.\n\nI believe the bank is fully aware of all these issues but is unwilling to accept responsibility for their shortcomings as far as account security to prevent fraudulent activity and then their failure to follow up when fraud is reported. I suppose to do so, to take responsibility, would be too costly and to take the low road, claiming no posting error has occurred on your account is the best response they could come up with. \n\nI request the bank reopen my claim for review. I request the {$5000.00} be returned to my account that was stolen via an unauthorized transfer on XX/XX/XX22. If the bank is unwilling to return the stolen funds, as required by Regulation E, I request a full report and documentation supporting their conclusion. I specifically request information as to the identity of the recipient of the funds, which the bank should have access to, and actions taken by the bank during the week of XX/XX/XX22, to investigate and stop this fraudulent transfer. \nI also ask the CFPB consider looking into B of As handling of this complaint as well as the many other similar complaints as this appears to be a recurring, systematic problem. It is your stated mission to make sure banks, lenders, and other financial institutions treat us fairly. Please do renew your commitment to that mission and make sure that B of A is treating its customers fairly.",

         "On XX/XX/XXXX, I Received a check from work and tried to deposit it online as I normally do. This check is the same as every other check I had successfully cashed in since I made my Bank Of ABC account on XX/XX/XXXX. After depositing this check online, I was given an email that I will receive the full amount into my debit account within 10 days. This was weird because I have never gotten this notice, however I decided to wait. However, I did not receive any of the money that I Submitted, and went to the bank to ask on the matter, and they simply told me that It might be due to the check being a too large of an amount and a period of time needs to pass before receiving the full amount, however, I received none of it. They also said that this might occur until my debit account is active for at least 6 months because of being a new account owner. That check was never deposited into my account, but on the XXXX, we tried to withdraw funds from our account and it rejected our attempt, and my account was suspended under \" suspicious activity ''. Again, we did nothing wrong, we had funds in our account to withdraw, not including the check that never got deposited, and immediately the account got suspended after trying to withdraw money that we had. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, My bank account was completely closed and We received an email from XXXX that my account will be suspended for 5 to 7 years. Also, without cause for close. There was no explanation as to why it was suspended, or why it was closed, other than \" closed for cause ''. We went to Bank of ABC XXXX to seek a solution and explanation, speaking multiple times through the phone, as well as visiting the bank and speaking with a banker in person. Every single time we were given no answer, with Bank of ABC telling us that there is no additional information as to why it was closed. We filed a dispute against, and requested a report from XXXX as to why the account was closed, and all we received was \" Reported for : Suspected Fraud Activity ; report is disputed by the consumer '' and Closure Status is \" Settled in Full ''. We then made additional attempts to contact them, and were told we needed \" additional Information '' to continue the dispute, however were not told what \" additional Information '' that is. We never received any other information or status update. We called multiple numbers of which we have records of with whom we spoke with, and that the calls were recorded, from XXXX, Bank of ABC, and other companies as to how to remove the block from my account and to no avail. Due to my account being closed and not being able to withdraw or add funds, which were still there, my credit score dropped XXXX points, and my wifes dropped XXXX points. On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of ABC finally gave us our funds from the closed account back that we had no access to. Around the similar time of the problem occurring, On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my Business License. To progress my career forward I needed and still do need to open a business bank account. However, that could not be done at Bank of ABC with me being in XXXX for no reason and them not being able to unlock my account. I went to XXXX to attempt to open a XXXX account, However they denied me as I am under XXXX as \" fraud and suspicious behavior '', again, to no explanation or details. I called multiple numbers to dispute this fraud status and try to get it removed, however, no one could help us or solve this issue. We then went back to Bank of ABC to explain the situation and that this XXXX report needs to be removed for me to open a business account with any company, and they were not able to help me in any way. They said that possibly going to a state bank rather than a federal bank could help as they might not pull up a XXXX report, however, that does not solve my problem in that the report should not even exist under my name. I need to open a business bank account and can not do so. My and my wifes credit score has suffered because of this problem. My career growth is paused because of this problem, and I am in serious consideration of filing lawsuit against XXXX and Bank of ABC for closing my account under no lawful, or explainable reason. I have done nothing incorrect, and have not committed any fraud in any way possible. I tried to submit a check as I always do ( I still have the original check that I attempted to deposit ), which did not work. I tried to withdraw funds as I always do, which did not work. None of this is my fault and I am suffering because of these two companies.",

The ATM transaction appeared as though it was going to go through, however no money was dispensed and no receipt was given. I grew uneasy about the situation and contacted Bank of ABC that same day and informed them of the situation. They told me that since the charge was pending yet, I could not file a dispute and that it should drop off. It never did. As soon as I saw that the charge had posted to my bank account, I informed XXXX XXXX, who told me I would have to dispute this with my bank. I called Bank of ABC and they referred me to the dispute department who filed claim # XXXX on my behalf. Bank of ABC contacted the ATM machined during the dispute process. They sent paperwork showing that a transaction was made and that money had gone through. A transaction was indeed attempted by me, however the ATM machine did not disperse any money. My claim was denied based on proof that a machine recorded a transaction, even though the machine did not provide any money. When my claim was denied, I immediately called Bank of ABC to request them to reopen and investigate the footage from the atm camera. They told me I just needed to send a signed written statement stating that I did not receive any money from the atm machine and they provided me with a fax number. I wrote a detailed letter, went to my Bank of ABC branch and had them fax over the letter immediately. My claim was denied a few days later. Bank of ABC provided me with an \" old fax number '' and they never received my written statement. At this point, I drove to the Bank of ABC once again and told them they gave me the wrong fax number and I sat down with a banker to insure she faxed it to the correct location. After a few days, they denied my claim for the third time saying they \" needed a receipt from the atm showing that I did not receive any money. '' The ATM never provided me with any receipt. I called to explain this to them and they told me that I would need to contact XXXX XXXX to request to see footage of the atm machine. I called XXXX XXXX and they told me that whenever there is an issue with the ATM, I need to dispute it with my Bank. Once again I call Bank of ABC to reexamine the claim. I get denied and am sent a letter telling me that my claim has been investigated multiple times and that it is denied and can not be reopened. I then get a letter in the mail stating that I attempted to withdraw {$500.00} twice that day and that one transaction went through and one did not. I realize then that this should be a fraud claim and not a dispute because I never attempted to withdraw that amount twice and I sure as XXXX did not receive any money. I call to request that my claim be treated as a fraud claim since this new information was uncovered. They tell me that they will treat it as fraud and they cancel my debit card under fraud protection and send me a new one. My claim is denied for the fifth time. I call and speak to a supervisor and she tells me I need to file a police report and even then that filing a police report will not guarantee that I will get my money back. I then drive to the police station to file a police report who informs me that since this took place in XXXX XXXX I would have to file a report there. I call Bank of ABC to tell them this since I live in California and they tell me because my claim was filed originally as a dispute that they CAN NOT file a fraud claim. This is complete insanity. We now know that someone else used my debit card, but they won't file a fraud claim because \" they can't do that if it was filed as a dispute originally. '' I am a victim of fraud. I have gone above and beyond to provide everything I can to bank of ABC to get my money back. I have been lied to, treated as a criminal, been given false promises and denied my rights to fraud protection under Bank of ABC Zero Fraud Liability Guarantee with the excuse that I filed a dispute and not a fraud claim. Yes I did this because at the time I was not AWARE that fraud had been committed on my atm card. I now know that someone, somehow fraudulenty used my atm card at this same machine and received money. Bank of ABC Zero Fraud Liability Guarantee states that the consumer will not have to pay for fraudulent transactions made by others using their Bank of ABC consumer and debit atm cards. Yet I am being denied and charged even after I keep telling them that this is a FRAUD case now. I am sorry that Bank of ABC has wrongly filed this as a dispute, but I am at my wits end explaining to them that I AM A VICTIM of fraud and under their Zero Fraud Liability Guarantee and Regulation E I am entitled to my money back. This should never have been filed as a dispute and it should have been filed as Fraud! Please uphold your policies and that of the United States government, check the atm cameras, do whatever you have to do and give me my money back!",

         "I received unemployment insurance compensation in the State of California. CA loads the benefits onto a Bank of ABC prepaid card. BofA has an online portal to activate the card, check balances, and transfer money to your bank account. The card and portal worked well for over a year. I had not used the portal to transfer money as I was satisfied using the prepaid card, but on XX/XX/XXXX a thief was able to gain access the BofA portal and change the p/w, email, & bank account and then transfer XXXX to their bank account. The BofA portal does not offer 2-factor authorization and BofA only alerted me after the transfer was completed. I called the BofA Fraud Claims XXXX and they opened Claim # XXXX and they assured me that they could see that it was fraud and the money would be restored to my account. I asked that all the money left in the account ( XXXX ) be sent to me in a check and even after talking to a supervisor they said it was not possible ( an incorrect statement ). I asked for the portal to be taken offline so the thief could not access it again and they said it was not possible but the supervisor changed my email, password, security questions and sent out a new debit card and I was told that if I did not activate the new card there could be no access to the funds in the portal. Before I received the new card the thief activated it changed the email, p/w, security questions, & added their bank account and immediately transferred another XXXX to their account on XX/XX/XXXX. I called the Fraud # and set up another claim # XXXX. We again changed the credentials with the fraud dept. and again I asked that the portal be removed but was told it could not be done. I spent 6 hours on the phone that day demanding that the remaining balance be sent to me via check and I was finally sent to the Funds Transfer Department and the issued a check for the balance of funds ( XXXX ). I now had a 0 balance in the portal but had 2 outstanding fraud claims totaling XXXX. I spoke with the Fraud protection supervisors and they assured me that the claims would be processed in my favor as it was clear fraud and that the portal could not be accessed by anyone including me because they noted that the card had been compromised/stolen. On XX/XX/XXXX claim # XXXX was completed and XXXX was credited to my account in the portal that I had no access to. A letter was mailed to me which I received on XX/XX/XXXX and I immediately called the Funds Transfer department to have the money sent to me but the thief had already transferred/stolen XXXX ( a new weekly limit BofA had initiated for their portal ). They sent a check for the XXXX balance and opened a new claim # XXXX for the XXXX that was just stolen on XX/XX/XXXX. Even though I had no active card or access to the portal and obviously a thief had full access, BofA refused to shut down the online portal. So now I have 2 open claims for a total of XXXX as follows XXXX for XXXX & XXXX for XXXX. Both of these claims have been denied 4 times now. The only explanation given for the denial is we have determined that no error has occurred and consider this claim resolved. I have spent 10 hours with the Fraud Department opening the claims back up for Reconsideration. Each time I speak with a supervisor who will take copious notes and assure me that they can see that this is obvious fraud and that it will get resolved. When I press to speak with the department that is denying the claims I am told it is impossible but that I can send them a fax ( I have faxed them XX times with no response ). I have asked 6 times for documentation on the denial of the claims and have only received a statement that shows charges that were made by me as well as the transfer that went to the thief and no other explanation. I have spent over 23 hours dealing with BofA and at this point they just parrot we need to let the research department do their job and there is nothing more we can do, the problem is that the Research Department keeps denying the claims and the Claims Department keeps sending it back to the Research Department for reconsideration in an endless loop ( over 100 days now ). My situation is not unique as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has done a story on the fact that the bankofABC.comXXXX website is not secure, has no 2-factor authorization, & millions of dollars have been stolen from consumers with no resolution from BofA.",

         "What these Banks do will shut a person 's, Businessman 's, a father 's, a farmer 's brain off. The law [ XX USC XX89 ] identify it a psychological, reputational and financial abuse, especially when they keep doing the same thing. when these Banks steal Billions and only have to pay back a small portion of what they steal, that is not incentive to stop the felonious activity. Most people do not know where to go to remedy the problem and the State of NC not goign to help as the foster & facilitate the behavior perpetuating slavery in perpetuity. I can not provide an account number because I am not sure of it because I did not participate, approve nor had knowledge of the {$460000.00} mortgage on my home until years later. I have been banned from the Courthouse in XXXX XXXX which I know is illegal but I am XXXX, that is what they do to hid the banks illicit activity. I would have never known about Bank of ABC involved in that loan until I received information from the US Attorney 's Office in Nevada trying to pay XXXX XXXX her portion of the settlement. ( but the house was not her house nor was it jointly titled, purchased ). The lied to the wife and used her to steal millions while I was out working and caring from my children. My working income is {$0.00} now due to the continual felonious activity of the Banks. My income dropped from about $ XXXX per month to {$0.00} due to the Banks and lawyers. The continual abuse, the lost of my homes caused serious injury to the entire family as defined in XX USC XX89 ( c ). the banks including XXXX XXXX Bank profited on the violation of 22 USC 848, XX USC Chapter 77, 95 and 96 es.al., Bank of ABC XXXX. is largely responsible for the wealth gap favoring XXXX over XXXX, favoring the wife over the husband violating the Civil Rights Act es.al. collectively the Banks stole over XXXX XXXX from me and my community and preventing many XXXX from owning and building a house for their family. This is a follow up to the complaint with Bank of ABC. I have been victimized by banks for over two decades losing about six millions. I firmly believe that Bank of ABC started it by facilitating the loan on my home back in XX/XX/XXXX for {$460000.00}. Prior to that, I have some information that Bank of ABC facilitated the embezzlement of millions from my construction company. XXXX Bank, XXXX Bank also participated in the laundering of proceeds as defined in XX USC XX56. When I tried to inquire with the Banks, they just ignore my request. Case in point, XXXX Bank purchased or merged with XXXX Bank. XXXX merged or purchased XXXX Bank. I had an account, an automatic renewal certificate of Deposit with XXXX Bank for {$XX000.00}. The XXXX was purchased in XXXX XXXX somewhere alone the lines, the $ XXXX 6.5 % was lost, misplaced and I never could get my money. XXXX stated they sent bulk money to the State Treasury without identifying information with it. I hired a Lawyer to help ( XXXX XXXX XXXX. The State Treasury stated that we had to get something from XXXX identifying that exact money and XXXX refused to provide it. I am not asking for the money back. i have moved beyond that. my primary objective is to show you that Banks and Lawyer and working in concert stealing proceeds, equity out of people 's houses and properties causing irreparable, immeasurable injury to the general public, the citizens of the United States. For me to reach this point, I think it is safe to say that I have been subjected to ever scam there is or more that any one person /family should have to deal with. After lawyer forged and records documents stealing millions working with the Banks, the NC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX officers/ lawyers, just as the forged documents, they will obstruct justice to silence their victim with threats, intimidation and false incarceration. It amaze me that they feel they have the inherited right to do as they do. it is like they first have the right to give away one 's money and the victims have to understand how to get it back, file charges and or sue to get back that which they stole as if the law does not protect XXXX but protect white, even when they are clearly wrong. if I break the law, I am charged, arrested and tried in a court of law, they break the law, they can restrain us or engage in more felonious activity to put distance between their criminal activity and the strong arm of the law. \n\nBank of ABC has been tired, adjudicate and found to be liable in a US California Court. ( see the attachment with the case number on it ) They do not want to acknowledge what they have done nor talk to me. The lawyer sin XXXX XXXX lied and led XXXX XXXX to believe she owned my home and the matter in California was adjudicated as if she owned my home when she really did not. it is like, what ever lie leave XXXX XXXX, that is what the XXXX accept even when country records show different, that is really bad for the stability of the economy of the XXXX community in North Carolina. I have complained to the NCDOJ, the NC State Bar, the NC XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the City of XXXX Police Department and the City of XXXX XXXX Council on XX/XX/XXXX to no avail. This State is still operating on the premises that XXXX people are to work and XXXX are entitled to the money, no one can anyone argue differently. Home after home, decade after decade, one Lawyer than another with each have their choice of Bank to implement their felonious activity. It is a common practice. The scary part about it is, when a lawyer find out that the previous lawyer was able to steal a few million, they will lie in wait. CASE IN POINT : XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX Bank, see the attachments. The only reason why I am still standing a little, not completely out for the count is because the {$340000.00} they stole belong to my community, family, workers, investors and subcontractors and not me personally money. XXXX Bank did it in XXXX, facilitating the theft of about {$800000.00} in a four month span. I have the Bank Statements but no law enforcement.",

I did not notice the charges right away when they started in XXXX, however, I was never alerted by my bank to the erroneous charges. I promptly canceled my card, shredded it and reported the fraud to my bank. With zero explanation other than \" the charges were consistent with previous charges on your card, '' Bank of ABC declined my fraud dispute. I did not hear back until XXXX about this matter. I spent hours on the phone on hold, being passed around to different departments, calls dropped and finally reached someone. They said this was unfortunate and that they would re-file a fraud dispute for me, but never asked me how much I was disputing. I heard nothing for about 3.5 weeks into XXXX when I decided to call Bank of ABC for a status check. The same dance occurred -- hours of hold, transferred me to wrong departments, calls drop, etc. I finally received human contact and explained my situation. She checked on my fraud dispute and the prior person only put into the system a claim on XXXX charge for {$110.00} and that it was also declined as fraud. She opened yet another claim for me and told me to send in any supporting documentation to support my claim. I essentially performed my own fraud investigation and line by line explained how each fraud charge could not possibly be mine -- gave them an XXXX sheet of every charge, provided receipts, airline tickets, train tickets, etc to prove that the charges I was disputing are not mine. I just received a letter in the mail saying that after re-evaluating my dispute, that I was once again denied because \" While I did not personally did not make the charges, we confirmed it was made by an authorized user on the account or someone who has permission to use the card. '' No one is has ever been authorized to use this card and I am the only person on the account. I have been carrying this amount on my card since XXXX, all the while making payments on it and collecting interest on the charges that are not mine. My bank will not believe me or protect me, which is absolutely absurd. Why would I put myself through the agony of waiting on hold for hours and spending hours line itemizing my own life to prove that these charges are not mine? Why would I cancel a card and request a new one? Bank of ABC customer service is absolutely terrible and once this is resolved and my card is at {$0.00} I will be closing all my accounts with them. Never in my life have I ever seen such blatant laziness, neglect and ignorance in protecting the consumer. It is remarkably clear these outlandish charges on my could not have been me. I have currently been on hold with Bank of ABC for the last XXXX minutes all while being passed to a total of XXXX wrong departments as of right now. \n\nI attached all supporting documents I personally paid to have delivered to Bank of ABC 's fraud claims department, which clearly outline how the charges could not be mine.",
